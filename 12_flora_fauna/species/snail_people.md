# The Snail People
Beneath the mountains of Bolog and Cuvauw dwell the Snail People in their domed caverns. They lounge in huts and tubes of moss and dried mucus, studying tomes of ancient lore and practicing with epees. All the while the peasant class of slug tend to the mushroom farms and algae pools.  Their most special fungi will cause hallucinations and give the imbiber a view into the dream realms.

Sorcerers from the Dusanglarot Lodge claim the Snail People taught them the secrets of alchemy and that the goblins of the south are a result of their early experiments.
