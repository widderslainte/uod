# The Undying Mantis Myrmidons

Despite the threats of further border skirmished, Mindat philosopher-scientists continue to make surreptitious expeditions to the isles west of the Shn continent.  They believe the mantis-folk living the fetid hills there bear some relationship to the remnants of experiments they have found in subterranean caverns left by the snail people.  The mantis-folk there have a warrior caste whose internal organs are replaced with an alchemical paste.  The organs are in term placed in oil covered pots which are secreted away in similar caves. This procedure is believed to slow the aging process and make one resilient to bleeding out from wounds in combat.
