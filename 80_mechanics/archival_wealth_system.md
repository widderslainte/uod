# Wealth System

* Vast Sum
* Tidy Sum
* A Sum
* Small Sum
* Pittance

# Treasure

* Each wealth level (above) can be described by at least one tag.  A Pittance can only be describe by one tag as it represents the single small divisible type.  

## Types
* Currency - coins, trade bars, and paper monies - can be used in most communities or exchange for other coints
* Luxuries - gems, jewelry, furs
* Supplies - can be used in the field or traded in most communities
* Raw Materials
* Foodstuffs - can be consumed, traded, but will go bad
* General goods (the default) - can be traded in any community

## Volume
A treasure may also be described by its volume, which is independent of its value.  A statue may be of normal size and be worth a vast sum, or be huge and worth a pittance.  Volumes:
* Normal (the default)
* Bulky
* Huge

## Other Tags
* Perishable
* Fragile
* Deceptive
* Flamable

## Appraisal
Normally values are not determined until the treasure is traded or brought home for experience.  Use of the appraisal skill can provide clues to the tags or values so that the most profitable items can be brought back with the available space.
