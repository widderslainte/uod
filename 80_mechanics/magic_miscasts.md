# Miscast

## Generic Miscast Table

| Roll 2d6 | Effect | 
|----------|--------|
|  2 | Spell fails. _Something really horrible happens._
|  3 | Spell fails. An extra dimensional entity has slipped into this reality through a hole created by the casting attempt. Treat as if the Summon spell has been cast, with the creature having Hit Dice equal  to the level of the spell originally attempted +1d4. Casterâ€™s roll for control is penalized by -4.
|  4 | Spell fails. Caster loses the ability to cast that spell.  Caster may research a new formula for that spell by normal spell research rules.
|  5 | Spell fails. _Effect to be determined._
|  6 | Spell fails. An entirely different spell has been cast. Randomly determine what spell was cast from the campaign spell list (reroll if the intended spell comes up) with a 1d10 effective caster level. If the spell requires a specific target or target area, determine this randomly.
|  7 | Spell fails. Sacrifice 100sp worth of valuable or ritual items after sunrise before the caster can cast again.
|  8 | Spell fails. _Effect to be determined._
|  9 | Spell fails. _Effect to be determined._
| 10 | (Intended) Spell fails. Treat as if the Confusion spell is cast, centered on the caster.
| 11 | Spell succeeds with maximum effect and remains in memory to be safely cast again (one time)
| 12 | _Something really miraculous happens._
