|Vessel of the Black Bile| Necromancy

|Level:| Magician 3
|Components:| V, S, M
|Casting Time:| (Ritual) 1 hour per subject's HD
|Range:| See Text
|Target:| 1 person

|Spell Resistance:| No

The ritual collects the hate, anger, and agression stored up within a person and dilutes
into a thick black liquid. The collection sucks essense (hp) out of the subject and infuses
it into the black liquid. The liquid will then do a similar amount of damage upon touch to
any target. The subject can sacrifice as many hit points as they would like (if willing) to
the collection, and the black liquid remains viable until the subject heals those hit points.
