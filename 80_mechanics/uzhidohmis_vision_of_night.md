# Uzhidohmi's Vision of Night

_Precept of Bliss_

The target is enchanted to see and be bedazzled by a myriad blinking lights/stars. This effectively keeps them from defending themselves.

* Method: Manipulation + Maetah Sorcery (+/- Modifiers)
* Modifiers:
* Success: Must achieve more success than the target's Resolve roll. If the spell succeeds, the target loses all defence bonuses for the duration.
* Drain: Base drain is Casting Pool, reduced by a normal soak roll.
* Duration: One scene.
