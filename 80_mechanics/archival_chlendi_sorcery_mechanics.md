# Chlendi Sorcery Mechanics
## Summoning Spirits
Each spirit has a Ftagn rating, which indicates it's degree of power. The force determines the strength and abilities of the spirit, as well as the difficulty to summon and control.

* Method: Manipulation + Chlendi Sorcery - Ftagn Rating (+/- Miscellaneous Modifiers)
* Success: One success means the spirit has been successfully called and owes the summoner as Service. Each additional success allows another Service owe, or and additional day of fealty.
* Duration: The spirit will stay until its completes it's service, on until the following sunrise, whichever comes first. Additional successes can be spent to add days of fealty.
* Drain: The base Drain is the Ftagn Rating of the spirit, in non-lethal damage. This can be reduced by success on a Resolve roll.

### Services
Examples of services a spirit can offer:

* Aid Sorcery (boost casting pool or absorb drain)
* Attack
* Divination (query the spirit's knowledge of its immediate surroundings or history)
* Physical service (move earth, break down gate)
* Surveillence (of the sorcerer or others)
