Call of the Minor Spirits
Magician, Level 1
Range: 10' + 10'/caster level
Duration: 6 turns
Casting Time: 1 turn
Comprehension: 90%

Effect: The Sorcerer can call one nearby minor spirit to his presense by means of incantations, offerings and burning incense.  This can be any spirit nearby, but also those of a local land feature such as forests, bodies of water, hills or large rocks, as well as those bound to shrines and places of prominence.  If the spirit reacts well to the call and offerings, it will truthfully answer one or more questions to best of its knowledge.  Make a roll on the table below with modifiers to determine the spirits response.  Upon the spirit's summons, additional offerings of items or service can be made in hopes of improving the spirit's willingness to answer, but even the most casual offers are taken by the spirit with the utmost seriousness.

The spirit will peacably depart upon the sorcerer's command, but remains no longer than one turn.
