#### Call of the Minor Spirits
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 10' + 10'/caster level  
Duration: 6 turns  
Casting Time: 1 turn  
Comprehension: 90%  

**Effect:** The Sorcerer can call one nearby minor spirit to his presense by means of incantations, offerings and burning incense.  This can be any spirit nearby, but also those of a local land feature such as forests, bodies of water, hills or large rocks, as well as those bound to shrines and places of prominence.  If the spirit reacts well to the call and offerings, it will truthfully answer one or more questions to best of its knowledge.  Make a roll on the table below with modifiers to determine the spirits response.  Upon the spirit's summons, additional offerings of items or service can be made in hopes of improving the spirit's willingness to answer, but even the most casual offers are taken by the spirit with the utmost seriousness.

The spirit will peacably depart upon the sorcerer's command, but remains no longer than one turn.

#### Summon Observer, Minor Form
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 10'  
Duration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level  
Casting Time: 1 turn  
Comprehension: 95%  

**Effect:** The sorceror summons a observer - an entity not quite as sentient or powerful as the most minor of spirits.  The minor form of watch only lasts a few hours more than a night, and has the intelligence comparable to a dog. The observer must remain within the sorceror's general range of sight or be rooted to the spot upon which they are evoked.  It can understand basic instructions and silently relay messages back to the sorcerer, waking or bring them out of a meditative state.  They have no corporeal form and cannot physically block or hold anything. Any attack or abjuration that would affect spirits or extraplanar creatures will immediate dissipate the observer spirit.

#### Chant of The Secret Visions 
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 20' + 10'/level  
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level with concentration  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Comprehension: 95%  

**Effect:** The sorceror chants while clutching a small piece of Amberite and staring into the sky or clouds, or into the amberite if indoors.  Use of the Chant while indoors is considered an ill omen, and only done as a last resort. While concentrating and staring through the amberite, spirits and spirit creatures are revealed. The spell does not grant into the names, powers, or true form of any entity detected, but calls into being a friendly appearence where the spirits are found - such as affable faces appear in trees or smiles form upon rocks.  Chlendi sorcerors are superstitious, but practical - any translucent gem or crystal of 100sp value or more can be used in place of amberite.

#### Renunciation from the World of Man
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 30'  
Duration: Instanct  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Comprehension: 75% 

**Effect:** Functions almost identically to the _Turn Undead_ spell, except that it only affects a single spirit.  All banished spirits are removed from the **Primeval Natural Plane**.

## Level 2

#### Call Lesser Spirit of War
Magician, Level 2 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 50’  
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Comprehension: 75%  

**Effect:** The sorcerer calls up a spirit from local genius loci to unleash violence.  The spirit (AC 17, HD 2, 1 Attack, Dmg 1d8) takes a visible form representing its nature, but can only attack the sorcerer's foes and will not engage in menial tasks or divination.  The spirit will disperse at the caster’s bidding, upon losing all its hit points, or at the end of the spell’s duration.  It can be banished by normal means.


## Level 3


# Classical Sorcery

## Miscellaneous Spells

## Level 2

#### Theft of the Body's Hearth
Magician, Level 2 - _Classical Sorcery Tradition_    
Range: Touch  
Duration: Permanent (Conditional)    
Casting Time: 1 round  
Saving Throw: Normal, Negates Effect  
Comprehension: 50%  

**Effect:** Caster's touch steals a rib from the target, with significant pain but no immediate damage.  Until the rib restored, the target can not heal (magical or otherwise, short of Grand Rituals).  If the rib is retrieved, it will painless slide back into place if touched upon the original target's skin.
