# Spells for the Magician, Magic-User, or Sorcerer

## Cantraps, not Cantrips
_Cantrap is an accepted spelling and the form that Jack Vance used.  I've decided on this form since Tactical Simulation Ruleset uses a slightly different system that AD&D.  And I like taunting spell-check._

1. No cantrip can directly interupt anothers concentration.
2. When influencing another or anothers possessions then that person is entitled to a save vs. spells.
3. Cantrips will not harm any magical item
