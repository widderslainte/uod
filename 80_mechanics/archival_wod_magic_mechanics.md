# WoD Magic Mechanics
### Magical Awareness
**Merit: Magical Awareness** is the prerequisite for performing any sort of magic. This separetes sorcerers from scholars. With the exception of extentuating circumstances, it can only be taken at character creation. Only 1 point is necessary, and it can be increased with experience. None of a character's Magical Skills can be higher than their current rating in Magical Awareness.

### Magical Skills
Magical effects work like other rolls. Roll: Attribute + Skill +/- Modifiers = Successes

Regardless of the success of the magic performance drain must be checked. The number of dice in the drain pool is determined by the type of sorcery minus Resolve. Any successes on this roll indicate bruise level of damage recieved.

#### Sample Magical Skills:
* Chlendi Summoning
* Traditional (Maetah)   
* Sorcery
* Alchemy
* Spirit Warfare

### Spirit Warfare

* Opposed Rolls: Man + Magical Skill (-1 if not aggressive)
* Loser take net bruise levels
