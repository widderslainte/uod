_Quoting Gygax_
"Large sums of lower value coins can be changed to a smaller number of larger value coins, and vice versa, at a relatively small cost — typically 3% of the transaction. This is done at the money changer’s. The money changer will also score as a banker, keeping funds and giving a marker to vouch for the amount. Note that bankers will not usually give any interest.

Bankers will give loans according to the reliability, renown, status, and material possessions of the individual. An unknown and low-level character is unlikely to get a loan without giving security for the value of the amount borrowed. Furthermore, the interest rate will be high — typically 10% per month or even 5% per week. A well-known and propertied character can typically get large loans at
relatively low interest — 1% per week or thereabouts. 

Jewelers, and gem merchants, will buy and sell jewelry and gems. The buying price will usually be 20% under the actual value of the piece or stone."
