# Stars & Constellations
According to Chlendi mythology , the constellations and stars symbolize the nature and structure of the universe. Each star is named, and reflects a point on the astral plane that connects to another area. Each constellation is a door to another realm, in which its component stars are particular spots/gates within that realm. A reference to the Zodiac or astrology reflects the passage of the individual's soul/spirit from a dying person or realm through the astral (through a constellation) to the birth spot.
