# Cosmology, Astronomy, & Time
## Time & Space in Uod

The Rhiat is the central continent (for gaming purposes) on the planet. It is located on the second planet of of the solar system, Uod, which by convention is reasonably similar to the Earth in the geological and astronomical sense. Both commoners and astronomers refer to the planet as Uod in a casual manner, just as we toss around the word "Earth". The Chlendi, original astrologers in the Rhiat, saw the universe as a system of spheres and planes. The stars were magickal points on the sphere that surrounded Uod, while the Sun and other planets existed in their own spheres. Pasdani, Khiduomo, and Nehia all have a couple moons, ignored by all but astrologers.

## The Years

The year is 3042. The Rhiat has been occupied by the Heteri people as long as anyone can remember. The Maetah arrived from the north 1500 years ago, and the Chlendi 500 years later. When the Mindat people came from the south, conquered numerous Heteri citystates, the Chlendi and Maetah allied as the Eskla 'Empire', and drove back the Mindat. After over a thousand years the Eskla pact dissolved through succession, outside threats, and interenal apathy. The Eskla 'officially' dissolved two hundred years ago, and most of the major nations of the Rhiat were at one time provinces within the Eskla.

### Days of the Week (also names of planets)

* Hyit (First Day)
* Pasdani
* Ikuyalhu
* Khiduomo (TempleDay)
* Iaovyus
* Nehia (MarketDay)
* BlackDay

Although the week has 7 days, more historic dates are listed by the decan, a period of 10 days used in the Mindat calendar, which is the oldest in the Rhiat. There are 36 decans in the year, based on the passage of the planets through the constellation. The reappearence of the planet Ikuyalhu in the constellation â€œThe Balefire" marks the beginning of a new year. Picking up on the astrological pattern, the Chlendi began to mark time by the decans, and found corresponding spirits to preside over each.

In the north, the Maetah followed a system on 10 months, which corresponede with the seasons and marked up well with the lunar calendar of the Heteri. The months of the year are:
