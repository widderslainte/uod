# Jeff's Twenty Questions - for Uod 

1. **What is the deal with my cleric's religion?**

    You likely a priest of the Maetah or Heteri, and may favor a pantheon member like Hilinavyu, The Coal God, or Utan the Destroyer, despite honoring the whole panatheon.  You may also be a ranking member of the clergy of Thedine, which rule along the North Sea as a theocracy and claim the Maetah Gods as demons.  You may be a leader of one of the numerous cult or a heterical self-declared Saint of the above religions.  The Chlendi people are animists and have little difference between cleric or magician.  If you of the Mindat of the south, you worship no god, but instead may be an honored teacher of the White Book, teaching others elements of Alchemy and the process of harnessing your inherent power through the trials.

2. **Where can we go to buy standard equipment?**

3. **Where can we go to get platemail custom fitted for this monster I just befriended?**

    Platemail is unusual in most any area of the main continent of Uod, but custom monster armor could be made through contacts in a local Guild of Arms or Commerce Guild (since they know *everyone*).

4. **Who is the mightiest wizard in the land?**

5. **Who is the greatest warrior in the land?**

6. **Who is the richest person in the land?**

7. **Where can we go to get some magical healing?**

8. **Where can we go to get cures for the following conditions: poison, disease, curse, level drain, lycanthropy, polymorph, alignment change, death, undeath?**

9. **Is there a magic guild my MU belongs to or that I can join in order to get more spells?**

    There are many, but membership isn't automatically granted.  Any city of reasonable size will have more than one.  They are typically called lodges, and following the style of a founding member from hundreds of years ago. Many sorcerers and magicians seek private mentors.

10. **Where can I find an alchemist, sage or other expert NPC?**

11. **Where can I hire mercenaries?**

12. **Is there any place on the map where swords are illegal, magic is outlawed or any other notable hassles from Johnny Law?**

13. **Which way to the nearest tavern?**

14. **What monsters are terrorizing the countryside sufficiently that if I kill them I will become famous?**

15. **Are there any wars brewing I could go fight?**
    * Territorial skirmishes continue on the border of Ramush and Argaevaligne, which Maetah nobles try to regain hereditary lands.
    * Factions in Ghikarn'gai seek revenge for their slavery by the Mindat Empire.
    * _Argaevaligne, led by the Thedine Theocracy, seeks to conquer remaining Maetah tribes on the edge of their realm.
    * Factions along the coast seek to retake Balancont from the Goblin armies.

16. **How about gladiatorial arenas complete with hard-won glory and fabulous cash prizes?**

    Along the coast in Vennosat, some of the old arenas may still be used during festival weeks.  You definitely can't find an underground fighting pit in Heteri dominated cities or large towns.  Definitely.

17. **Are there any secret societies with sinister agendas I could join and/or fight?**

18. **What is there to eat around here?**

    Lots of root vegetables, served in various forms.  Further south Nogs are renowned for their sandwiches, a novel concept that has yet to have taken on elsewhere.  The Chlendi swamp dwellers are fond of frogs, shellfish, and slugham.

19. **Any legendary lost treasures I could be looking for?**

20. **Where is the nearest dragon or other monster with Type H treasure?**

    Foul beasts live in the swamps to west, but you may face one of the dread Chlendi land squids before you even reach the ruins of their cities.  Heteri clanmothers speak of Wyrms and other creatures live in the hills to the east, where they crawled from the subterranean furnaces of the Coal God.  Of course you could dispense with monster hunting altogether if you're crazy enough to raid the villa of a clan tied to the Commerce Guild.

3. What about raising the dead?  Yes.  Are you sure you want to?  Really?
4. How are replacement PCs handled? You can play a nog.  Or promote a henchmen, otherwise get you in as quick as possible using the rule of Cool/Weird/Plausible.
5. Initiative: individual, group, or something else? Group d6, high wins, but my Guisarme pseudo-AD&D version may take over.
6. Are there critical hits and fumbles? How do they work? - Natural 20 double damage, kills foes of 1 HD or less.
7. Do I get any benefits for wearing a helmet? - 
8. Can I hurt my friends if I fire into melee or do something similarly silly? - most likely

18. Can I buy magic items? Oh, come on: how about just potions? - Scrolls and potions, but the sources won't have a big sign out front.  Also, healing potions are the blue milk from Star Wars.
19. Can I create magic items? When and how? Lower level Magicians can create scrolls and talismans.  Prophets can create scrolls.  Potions when you get a little higher.  Level 9+ for the big stuff.
20. What about splitting the party? Sure, but if half the players get bored, unfortunate events may drive you back together.
