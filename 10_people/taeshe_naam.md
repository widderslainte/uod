## Taeshe Naam, Slave Lord of Narrosh

Taeshe Naam is a massive, wrinkly, shell of a man.  His mere glance frightens children and the scuttling approach of the nogs carrying his palanquin can settle a dispute.  Taeshe has a booming laugh, a boisterious manner, and makes a delerious profit running the slave market of Narrosh. 

Taeshe Naam was an aspiring student in the Duslangarot sorceror's lodge until an alchemical accident left him scarred, crippled, and unabled to walk.  He spent the following years running the books on his family's grain trade in the city market.  When his father fell victim to a gang dispute, Naam called in favours from his old mentor and reapplied himself to the study of alchemy.  After the leaders of all the major slave trading gangs fell ill and found their wares mysteriously poisoned, Naam stepped in to oversee there operations.

Uneasy truce with Vuhwul Nakai.  Naam knows Nakai could shut down his operations with little more than a thought, but it would take years to hope to achieve the cooperation of the slavers beyond city-state's reach and the numerous gangs with a hand in city's market and export operations.
