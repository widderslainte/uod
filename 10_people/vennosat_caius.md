Vennosat-Caius
Caius Nym family has wealth and land holdings in Vennosat City and the social status dates back to Eschlatliu times, when the fmaily patriarch was ministaer of foeign trade and consort to te temple of Besalakas.  Since those centuries their influence and business has stagnated.  Interest and holdings have maintained the family's estate and lifestyle, but the merchant company is all but a front.  Throughout Vennosat (as well as the old money circles of Eschlatli descent elsewhere) the name is known but accorded basic respect only as a matter of tact.  Caius seeks fame, status, and respect in Noduan and will do anything to recieve it.  He doesn't care about power or wealth.  He has that at home.
