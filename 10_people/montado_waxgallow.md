Montado Waxgallow, presumed Lich

* Eskla, came from the cities of the Minkush River Valley (in northern continent), left to avoid complications (enemies?)
* At lest a few hundred years old.
* Has been here since before the Mindat
* Dislikes Red Lizardfolk - "scholarly disagreement"
* Grand City of the Red Lizardfolk at the head of the North River
* Other lizardfolk are generally hospitable, but the tribes oftern war among themselves.  Black lizardfolk inhabit the swamps to the north.
* Hills beyond the South River
* Onesuli is some sort of patron or guardian of the regions and it's flora and fauna.  
* Others like him exist, but less well-temperate and noble of intention
* Swamp out beyond (Wooden Priest's mound).  Sorcerers went there to open a gate.  Doesn't know if they were successful, but he (Montado) has their skulls.  Green Lizardfolk village nearby.
* Boglai was originally small fishing village used by pirates and scoundrels to hideout.
* Siltolo - has grown significantly over years.  Really only cares for silvers - eating hearts is just amusement.  No real motives known - may just be a mischevious entity.
