#### Call of the Minor Spirits
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 10' + 10'/caster level  
Duration: 6 turns  
Casting Time: 1 turn  
Comprehension: 90%  

**Effect:** The Sorcerer can call one nearby minor spirit to his presense by means of incantations, offerings and burning incense.  This can be any spirit nearby, but also those of a local land feature such as forests, bodies of water, hills or large rocks, as well as those bound to shrines and places of prominence.  If the spirit reacts well to the call and offerings, it will truthfully answer one or more questions to best of its knowledge.  Make a roll on the table below with modifiers to determine the spirits response.  Upon the spirit's summons, additional offerings of items or service can be made in hopes of improving the spirit's willingness to answer, but even the most casual offers are taken by the spirit with the utmost seriousness.

The spirit will peacably depart upon the sorcerer's command, but remains no longer than one turn.

#### Summon Observer, Minor Form
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 10'  
Duration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level  
Casting Time: 1 turn  
Comprehension: 95%  

**Effect:** The sorceror summons a observer - an entity not quite as sentient or powerful as the most minor of spirits.  The minor form of watch only lasts a few hours more than a night, and has the intelligence comparable to a dog. The observer must remain within the sorceror's general range of sight or be rooted to the spot upon which they are evoked.  It can understand basic instructions and silently relay messages back to the sorcerer, waking or bring them out of a meditative state.  They have no corporeal form and cannot physically block or hold anything. Any attack or abjuration that would affect spirits or extraplanar creatures will immediate dissipate the observer spirit.

#### Chant of The Secret Visions 
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 20' + 10'/level  
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level with concentration  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Comprehension: 95%  

**Effect:** The sorceror chants while clutching a small piece of Amberite and staring into the sky or clouds, or into the amberite if indoors.  Use of the Chant while indoors is considered an ill omen, and only done as a last resort. While concentrating and staring through the amberite, spirits and spirit creatures are revealed. The spell does not grant into the names, powers, or true form of any entity detected, but calls into being a friendly appearence where the spirits are found - such as affable faces appear in trees or smiles form upon rocks.  Chlendi sorcerors are superstitious, but practical - any translucent gem or crystal of 100sp value or more can be used in place of amberite.

#### Renunciation from the World of Man
Magician, Level 1 - _Chlendi Tradition_  
Range: 30'  
Duration: Instanct  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Comprehension: 75% 

**Effect:** Functions almost identically to the _Turn Undead_ spell, except that it only affects a single spirit.  All banished spirits are removed from the **Primeval Natural Plane**.

(Spirit) Animal Messenger
Level 1 Enchantment 
Components: V, S, M,
Target: One Tiny animal

You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message.

Spirit Ward
Range: 0 Duration: 1 hour
The onmyoji gains +1 to AC, TD and all saves. Additionally, no spirit creature may touch the onmyoji (though they may use spells or missiles) as long as the onmyoji refrains from attacking such creatures.

Summon Monster I
Level 1 Conjuration (Summoning)
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. Information on these creatures can be found in the Monster Manual.

* Celestial dog
* Giant rat
* Celestial owl
* Raven
* Celestial giant fire beetle
* Giant Centipede
* Celestial monkey
* Scorpion
* Snake, small viper
* Hawk

* Spider

Trance
Level 1 Divination
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: 120 ft.
Area: 120 ft. spread, centered on you
Duration: 1 round/level

You place yourself in a deep trance, during which you cannot move, speak, or take any action.
In the trance, you are highly attuned to the powers and forces in the immediate area. You can sense certain magical creatures and effects within the spell's area. Each round you remain in the trance, you feel the presence of any one lesser spirit, greater spirit, curse, permanent magical effect, or haunting within the spell's area. You can determine the general type of thing contacted (such as natural spirit, evil haunting), but cannot communicate with it in any way or gain any other information about it. Using this spell does give you enough information to subsequently cast commune with lesser spirit or a similar spell to communicate with the spirit you desire to contact.

## Level 2 Spell Descriptions

Ancestral Vengeance
Level 2 Conjuration
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: Yes

You call out to an ancestral spirit, listing the crimes of your target and urging your ancestor to punish the miscreant. The ancestral spirit imposes this punishment in the form of a sharp blow to the target. This attack hits automatically and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6), or 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 10d6) if the target is undead. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half.

Augury
Level 2 Divination
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Duration: Instantaneous

An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. For example, if a character is considering destroying a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury might determine whether that act is a good idea. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:

Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
Woe (for bad results).
Weal and woe (for both).
Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).


If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result, with no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. Material Component: Incense worth at least 25 gp.

Calm Emotions
Level 2 Enchantment 
Components: V, S, DF,
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area: Creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, but may defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Commune With Lesser Spirit
Level 2 Divination
Components: V, S, M,
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 10 ft.
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

You contact a local spirit—any spirit creature with 4 or fewer HD. You must know the identity of the spirit (which you can learn through the trance spell), and you must be within 10 feet of the spirit's location.
You may ask up to one question per 2 caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.
The spirit's knowledge is limited to matters within its immediate area. Spirits usually answer questions literally and do not volunteer any information. If the spirit's alignment is different from yours, the spirit gets a Will save to resist the spell. If the spirit has been subject to commune with lesser spirit within the past week, the new spell fails. Good spirits generally try to be helpful in answering questions, while evil spirits always try to distort the information they give (though they generally give literally truthful answers).
Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 10 gp.

Invisibility to Spirits
Level 2 Abjuration
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Target: One touched creature/level
Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates

This spell prevents spirits from perceiving the warded creatures and acts as though the warded creatures are not there. The warded creatures can move freely among spirits without being noticed, although they are perfectly visible to all other types of creatures. If a warded creature touches or attacks a spirit, the spell ends for all recipients. Note: A spirit gets one saving throw against the spell. It either sees all the warded creatures or none of them. Material Component: Red ink, with which you write prayers on each target.

Kami's Vengeance
Range: 30' Duration: 1 round/2 levels
A companion spirit materializes and attacks as directed by the onmyoji, striking at +3 and dealing 2d6 damage, 3d6 damage against undead or demon Opponents.

Protection from Spirits
Level 2 Abjuration
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Touch
Area: Emanates 5 ft. from touched creature
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No (see text)

This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 5 feet. The barrier moves with the subject and provides  a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks made by spirits. The barrier also prevents spirits from entering the area. This protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against a blocked spirit. Spell resistance can allow a spirit to overcome this protection and enter the circle. Material Component: Amber and paper prayer strips.

Rebuke
Level 2 Conjuration
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1d4+1 rounds
Saving Throw: Yes

With a thunderous rebuke, you stun one creature of your choice within range. If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, it is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain a +2 bonus to attack it.

Spiritual Barrier
Range: 90' Duration: 6 rounds
The target must save vs. earth or be unable to cast spells or use any supernatural abilities.

Summon Lesser Spirit
Range: 30' Duration: 1 hour
A spirit creature (AC 18 TD 15, HD 3, Att 1 strike, Dmg 1d8) appears and obeys the onmyoji's
commands until slain or the spell ends

There is a 10% chance per level of the Shaman that the spirit will respond if the spirit's name is not known. If it is known, the spirit always responds. The Shaman may ask up to one question per level that the spirit will answer to the best of its ability. The Shaman could instead bargain with the spirit for some sort of aid, but promises of returned aid will be necessary, and curses could apply if the Shaman tries to default on such promises.

Others must obviously be present in order to hear the spirit's answers. If the name of a spirit is not known, roll 1d6: 1-2 a friendly spirit possesses the Shaman, 3-4 the spell fails, 5-6 a malevolent spirit or demon possesses the Shaman, hoping to keep the body permanently. The GM determines on what conditions the spirit leaves the Shaman's body.

* " _Dealing with spirits is an important part of the magic system in Ghastly Affair, my Gothic OGL game._ "

 _It's Magician class is deeply informed by “historical” and literary magic. It can utilize Ceremonies to summon spirits or affect targets at a distance, create Talismans that confer constant magical effects, and activate Pacts that cause spirits to create extraordinary effects in return for sacrifices or services. Of course, a Magician could also cause an “Elf Stroke” in a victim by using her wand or magic dagger. By deciding whether a character primarily uses Incantations, Ceremonies, Talismans, or Pacts, the Class can easily be run as an academic occultist, religious theurgist, witch, or even a tribal shaman. There are also suggested rules for the effects of the most common herbs and drugs used historically by witches and sorcerers, if you want to include that in your game._

_Ghastly Affair also includes a “Demon Hunter” Class. The class is skilled in combat, and can identify disguised supernatural beings (and knows their weaknesses). The Game has a “Faith” mechanic that allows any virtuous person to attempt to ward off supernatural evil. If your Demon Hunter can keep herself from becoming twisted by the horrors and immorality of the world around her, she can repulse demons._
