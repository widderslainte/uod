## Alchemy Philosophies

### Speculative Alchemy
"You understand the basic truth of alchemy - that the impure can be turned into something pure, the base can be turned into something noble. Join us, and we will show you that the worthy human can also be turned into something purer and nobler."
Speculative Alchemy is a specialization in the metaphysical aspects of natural science, and how the chemical processes can be harassed to purify the human soul.

### Pragmatic Alchemy
Pragmatic alchemy focuses on knowledge and skill, in an effort to utilize and manipute the natural properties of biological, chemical, and mineral substances. It veers in the direction of chemistry, medicine, and herbalism.
