# Known Chlendi Spirits

* **Itil-called-the-Vengeful** - Chlendi War Spirit - called to lay blessings upon weapons, advise on strategies of war, and (in extreme cases) invoked to posses warriors.
* **The Sovereign Prince of Knowledge** - The Sovereign Prince of Knowledge is the Chlendi spirit of knowledge and secrets. He has a true name, but it is the one piece of lore he shares with no one. This invocation calls forth the Sovereign Prince to fill one's consciousness and aid in the learning of sorcery. The invocation takes 4 hours during the proper astrological alignment and requires offerings of incense, blood, and flower petals. During the ritual, the sorcerer speaks aloud in a variety of tongues, most of dead langauges, writhes upon the floor, and his eyes roll back and are glazed in yellow. The sorcerer will then have the ability to impart one spell into his personal collection, but at price of unhealing wounds that last for one or more days. The invocation can not be reattempted until previous wounds have healed.

* **The Tail Prince** - The Tall Prince is a Chlendi Spirit of Vengeance, with teeth of ivory and eyes of gold.  He is said to be the prince of a forgotten Chlendi clan, whose father poisoned him in the night so as to steal the prince's new bride.  To summon him, seek out the poisonous dewbite mushrooms in the deepest swamplands.  Prepare a broth of their stems and drink it at dusk.  When two moons appear as three, place a copper coin in your mouth, count to ten, and swallow it.  If your cause if just, you will awake when your vengeance is done.  The only cost is your little finger. During the 3rd Century, it became fashionable in some southern cities to remove the little finger from one's offhand to give an aura of machismo.  Youths and ne'er-do-wells would graffiti a four-fingered hand on the doors and buildings as a sign of intimidation. 
* **Paeglaphiis**, Chlendi spirit of disease
