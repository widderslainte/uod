# Known Chlendi Spirits

* Itil-called-the-Vengeful - Chlendi War Spirit - called to lay blessings upon weapons, advise on strategies of war, and (in extreme cases) invoked to posses warriors.
* The Sovereign Prince of Knowledge - The Sovereign Prince of Knowledge is the Chlendi spirit of knowledge and secrets. He has a true name, but it is the one piece of lore he shares with no one. This invocation calls forth the Sovereign Prince to fill one's consciousness and aid in the learning of sorcery. The invocation takes 4 hours during the proper astrological alignment and requires offerings of incense, blood, and flower petals. During the ritual, the sorcerer speaks aloud in a variety of tongues, most of dead langauges, writhes upon the floor, and his eyes roll back and are glazed in yellow. The sorcerer will then have the ability to impart one spell into his personal collection, but at price of unhealing wounds that last for one or more days. The invocation can not be reattempted until previous wounds have healed.
