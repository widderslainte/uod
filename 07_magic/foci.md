## Foci

Items used to focus existing magical energy, increasing the power/effect/success rate of rituals and spells.

* Foci are often indistinguishable from magical tools or reservoirs.
* Exist as general, or specific to a particular arcane knowledge, cyraptii, magical tradition, or even individual rites.
