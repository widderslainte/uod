## The Vumach Sign

The Vumach sign is said to have been taught to Heteri shamans by the four-armed frog people that lived in the mountain passes southeast of Sofegai.  The arrangement of one's fingers on a human hand requires much more practice and flexibility.  The proper display of the Vumach Sign will make spirits and creatures of other spheres pause, allowing time to prepare an incantation of defense (or allow those of wisdom to flee the scene).
