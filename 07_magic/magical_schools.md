# Magical Schools
## Magickal Schools of The Rhiat

The magickal knowledge of Rhiat is preserved, dispersed, and instructed in a number of ways. Individual teachers, often hermits, or sorcereors in remote regions take on small numbers of pupils. Less complex traditions are taught in conjunction with other intellectual training (astronomers teach astrology, priesthood’s mysticism, etc). The most famous and effective sorcerers have left behind an intellectual tradition through generation after generation of students, similar to the academies of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. These are named after the founding mage. Other schools develop around a group, or faculty of teaching sorcerers, who specialize in a few of these methods or arcane knowledges.

### Theoretical Rivalries 
The primary division among the magickal schools is the spritualist/antispiritualist divide. Within each of the perspectives all fo the schools can agree on at leat the most general principles.

* **Antispiritualists** – Focus on matter to th exclusion of spirit.
* **Alchemists**
* **Vibrationalists** – includes study of music based (nym – Pythagorean) magick.
* **Spiritualists** – Includes most other philosophies and religions. Also encompases some breeds of alchemists1 and various heretical vibrationalists.
* **Necromantists** - A magickal school based on heretical Shn-k’varush beliefs that originated out of Mindat. These sorcerors feel they can command and bargain with ancestor spirits by controlling their fetters.
* **N’Ka** – a magickal school dedicated to the understanding of the ind and congniive thought, which encompasses some paradigms of Ushre Atam (Precept of Bliss) and traditions of mysticism. They acknowledge the existence and power of spirits (thus excluding them from the Antispiritualists), but feel that traffic with them is dangerous, inefficient. This school is one of the few magickal traditions to be tolerated by the Tegairne Faith. (Scientologist/Mind control angle, Push to merchant council, Work w/ alchemists)
