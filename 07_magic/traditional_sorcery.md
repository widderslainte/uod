# Traditional Sorcery

Sorcery is the general art of changing the reality in conformity with desire. Hedge magicians among the Maetah first developed the techniques commonly associated with modern sorcery in the Rhiat. Because of its decentralized, individualistic development, the discipline went uncodified, and rather under-theorized for hundreds of years. When the Maetah people were enslaved as manual laborers for the Chlendi, the mystics and academicians, among them sought to master and understand the Maetah sorcery. Subsequently, the standard terminology and theory of sorcery exists in the vocabulary of the Chlendi tongue.

## Historical and Cultural Background
**Origin Nature** – Non-sentient. Omnessence is found in all living things as well as nature.
**Origin Form** – Essence

**Origin Genesis** – This origin was originally the creator deity of the Maetah pantheon, Amrikol. During the mythic period, Amrikol was confronted and destroyed by his family, the majority of the other members of the pantheon. Alternate versions of the mythology tell that the pantheon sacrificed Amrikol to give life to humanity, or that Amrikol sacrificed himself to do so, in spite of the pantheon. Regardless, upon his death, his essence infused the world, giving thought, emotion, and sentience to humanity, and infusing many item and species with his omnessence. By giving this power to humanity and the world, trained practitioners could access the power of divinities without the need for pacts and grants.

**Origin Relations** – Ultimately related, but the omnessence forged from Amrikol could not be accessed in any other fashion.

**Origin Orientation** – Visceral (non-sentient)

**Origin Relations** – None, unaware of practicioners.

**Omnessence Utilization** - Traditional sorcery uses omnessence in the following ways:
* Powered by hard omnessence - material items, of animal, vegetable, or mineral composition.
* Ritualized with sympathetic links
* Powered by innate omnessence – results in physical harm to the practitioner.

## Invocation Examples
* Blood Blessing of Musthyoch - By the blood of a sow, a blade is blessed.
* Strength of the Unplowed Earth
* Uzhidohmi's Vision of Night
* The Red Mark
