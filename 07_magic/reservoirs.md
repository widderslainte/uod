# Resevoirs

Resevoirs are charged items used to store magickal energy.  Commom forms include:

* **Glyphs** - inscribed in portable items or on meaningful locales (such as carven pentacles)
* **Shrines** - non-portable - offerings left may eventually charge the area.  Many shrines are often built in proximity of ley lines.
* **Magical tools** - items that have a function to the practitioner in addition to reservoir capacity.  Many items obtain a magical charge through years of ritual use.
* **Eyes** - Chlendi Tradition - Often the eyes of practitioners or magical creatures, they are preservers then enchanted for storage.
