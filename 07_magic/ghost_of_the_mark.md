# Ghost of the Mark

Shamed by a grand military loss against the Chlendi, a Maetah warlord sought to save face by marking himself with a tattoo as acknowledgment of his failure. His subordinate, bitter from the loss, poisoned the tattoo ink as retribution, killing the warlord in his moment of shame.

His ghost inhibits the tattoo which has crawled from person to person via human contact for centuries.
