# Theurgy

Hermetic form of magick guided by meditation, self discipline, and the invocation of the empyreal essense of one's self. At the highest form, the Theurgist maintains contact with a physical manifestation of the eidolon.

In the Mindat form, there is no true divine equivalent component, but rather it iscentered on the idea that the theurgist is becoming closer to the fragment of divinity that all humans have in themselves.  In the case
of the Mindat, they killed their gods to (among other reasons) release more of their energy and enchance their own divine elements.

While not really psionic, here are ideas to inspire:

* Attack: Psionic Blast, Mind Thrust, Ego Whip, Id Insinuation, Psychic Crush
* Defense: Mind Blank, Thought Shield, Mental Barrier, Intellect Fortress, Tower of Iron Will
