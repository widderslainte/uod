# Ciirapti

*Ciirapti* is a Chlendi term that literally means "skill of thought", and originated in Chlendi schools of philosophy back in the Motherland. The ciirapti was a student's course of study for the term under a single *shufilli*, or master. All students were referred to as *enfants* until they completed the course of study, and acquired the title of shufilki upon it's successful completion.
