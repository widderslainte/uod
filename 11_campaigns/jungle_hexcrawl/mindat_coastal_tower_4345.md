### Slime Skeletons
2 HD
AC 7 (?)
Upon a hit they will grab the limb of the attack with the other limb.  The following round slime will begin to crawl from the skeleton to the target.  The target will then take 1d6 damage from the slime corroding the flesh.  The slime will spead and do additional damage overnight (or everyday).  If killed by this damage the slime will overtake the corpse and raise it as a skeleton.  Fire, acid, holy water or a Cure Disease spell will remove the slime.
