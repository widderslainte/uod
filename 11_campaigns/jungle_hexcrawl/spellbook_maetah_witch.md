### Spell Descriptions

#### Coven's Vengeance
Magician, 1st Level - _Precept of Fury_
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 50'+ 5'/level

Casting of this spell requires blood - a pint or more for the uninitiated, but just a serious (1hp damage) cut to oneself for those trained in the tradition.  Upon the spilling of blood and whispering of words, bolts of a viscous red-blood like enemy surge forth towards the desired target(s).  The bolts will always hit if the target can be seen, regardless of cover or engagement.  A shield spell or similar will absorb the attack.

Upon hitting, each bolt does 1d4+1 points of damage.  A second cut (or pint) will increase the damaged to 1d4+2 points. A magician of 3rd level generates 2 bolts of the viscous energy, and 3 bolts upon attaining 5th level.  Bolts can directed between multiple targets.  Each additional bolt loosed requires additional sacrifice of blood. No saving throw is allowed.


#### Foeretch
Magician, 2st Level - _Precept of Fury_
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 100'
