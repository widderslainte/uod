# Campaign Rules and Rulings
**Changelog**
* 2019/12/15 document start

## Defaults and Assumptions
In between character creation at campaign start and the first 3 or 4 sessions, we effectively switched from BX (Moldvay) to Lamentations of the Flame Princess.  When in doubt refer to the 2013 "Player Core Book:
Rules & Magic".  For items not covered there or in this document, refer back to BX (Moldvay).  For items still not covered, we'll fall back on the Gospels of Saint Gygax.

## Modifications 

### Character Creation 
#### Ancestry
* Choose from the following, either individually or in combination (mixed ancestry other than Eskla, "ancestrally Heteri, but raised among the Mindat", etc).  Details can be found on Uod sites.
    * Chlendi
    * Eskla
    * Heteri
    * Maetah
    * Mindat
#### Choose a Character Class
* Only Cleric, Fighter, Magic-User, and Specialist are available. 
* Dwarf - Elf, Halfling - No actual dwarves, elves or halflings, but with negotiation you could potentially use their rules in some other fashion (halfling rules for scout,etc) 
#### Determine Hit Points
* Maximum hit points at first level
* When gaining a level, roll all hit dice and choose if higher ("Empire of Petal Throne method")
#### Choose a Name
* Choose name based off character's culture - examples in Uod wiki, but make your own that sounds "right" to you compared to other examples.

### Adventuring: The Rules of the Game 
#### Experience Points
* Defeating Enemies - XP values from BX (Molday) will generally be used
* Recovering Treasure 
* Gaining a Level

#### Foraging and Hunting
* Travel rules from **Forbidden Lands** are generally used instead
#### Getting Lost
* Travel rules from **Forbidden Lands** are generally used instead
#### Hazards
* Damage
    * We have not been using, but probably should:
    _"When his Hit Points reach 0, the character becomes unable to take any action, and in most cases falls completely unconscious. The character becomes mortally wounded at –3 Hit Points and will die in 1d10 minutes. No healing, magical or otherwise, can prevent death at this point. Death is instantaneous at –4 Hit Points."_

#### Healing


### Combat
* Initiative
    * Group initiative is used
    * Declare intended actions before round
    * Initiative ties generally go to the PCs at the DM's discretion
    * Actions are taken in order of Moldvay Basic (**SHAWN NEEDS TO ADD HERE**)
* Other Combat Issues
    * **"Shields be Splintered"** is used - a shield can be sacrificed (effectively destroyed) to negate the effect of an attack.
    * See **Damage** above
