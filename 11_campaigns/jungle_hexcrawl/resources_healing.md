* **Rest** - Per rulebook

###  Resource Forms
_costs assume standard of 1 silver piece_
* **Potions of Healing** - restore 1d8 hit points.  Those crafted by the Mindat tend to be cloudly to opaque sky blue liquid, with a mild dairy aftertaste. Standard encumberance applies.
* **Healing Poultices** - restore 1 hit point per character level if applied immediately.  Doubles natural healing if applied for a full night's rest.  Can not be effectively use for both immediate and overnight relief.  Poultices occupy a small pouch's worth of space with the encumbrance of 5 gold coins, and are typically a moist mossy material.  Healing poultices are rendered ineffective by water and lose potentcy after one week.
