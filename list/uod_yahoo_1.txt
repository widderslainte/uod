Yes.  The Maetah is the culture that Argaevaligne developed from.  Much like Rome was polytheistic before Constantine converted them to Xtianity. There are other communities of Maetah, and others that follow their pantheon.  Both the Heteri and Maetah pantheons are fairly common (in varying degrees) in Ramush, Nipend, Vensat, and Balaconth.|

11|11|2003-02-14 14:55:33|widderslainte|[Religion] Maetah Pantheon Notes|Musthyoch - Lord of Life  The early Maetah saw Musthyoch as one of their major deities.  All plants and animals (including humanity) were seen as his children and servants, in one manner or another.  Particular animals were idolized in beast cults, which were subservient to Musthyoch, and stereotypical qualities of these animals (strength of bulls) were used to represent other gods.  For example, Thedine was originally a bull cult, showing the strength and stability of the bull, and the earth with the connection that bulls (and oxen) were used in cultivation.  Musthyoch was also known as the 'Emperor of All Flesh' and is pictured as a blue-skinned humanoid, although this imagery does not pass on to modern times.  By the period of the Eschaltli Empire, Mustyoch is idolized as a short, hooded figure of undetermined gender.  In later times (early Maldaer colonies on the North Sea plateau), two of these beast cults came to prominence:  Lob and Ubo, the sons of Musthyoch.|

13|13|2003-02-14 15:06:27|widderslainte|[Religion] General Religious Notes|The next couple posts are a couple years old, so there may be some modifications to what's posted in these files.  Most of it's still of use though...  Maetah Religion  The Maetah pantheon is a confused mix of foreign theology, syncretism, and conceptual changes due to evolving subsistence methods and general cultural change.  The original pantheon was a selection of deities brought over by the original ethnic stock, and modified by the acclimation to the geography of settlers.  The southern (proper) Maetah, who passed this pantheon to modern peoples, also had a great deal of influence from Heteri (and thus Mindat) religion.  When the Chlendi moved in the North Sea plateau, we see two differing syncretic trends: The transformation of Thedine/Tegairne into a monotheistic moral entity and the envelopment of Chlendi spirits into the mythology of the region.|

14|14|2003-02-14 15:07:29|widderslainte|[Religion] Maetah Deities: Lob|Lob - The Tusked God  Before the coming of the Maetah to the North Sea Coast, Lob was the Beast God of the porcine animals, which in those lands were primarily pigs and swine.  His primary patrons were among the people of the farms and husbandries, the fat and happy overlords of the lands that the majority of the Maetah population worked.  Lob's lineage, the Clan of the Fattened Young, existed in opposition to the agricultural Clan of the Fertile Earth, and its subsidiary lineages, who toiled in the fields.   But upon migration, the Maetah found it difficult to adapt their fattened hogs to the rough winters of the northern plateau.  Facing a cold response from the budding agriculturalists that followed Thedine, and even colder lonely winter, they turned to the only clan of the interior lands they had not alienated, the hunters.  The early Maetah hunters were an odd lot.  They were among the most physically fit, but who neither had the interest nor the aptitude to take up the rough and monotonous agricultural life of the farmers.  Many other were opportunist who saw the struggles of the tribe in the new environment, and took the chance to gain in status.  Many others were low or no status, and both nothing to loose, and no other choice.  The Clan of the Fattened Young saw promise in the study of the hunting community, and still commodities from the homelands, as wells high ranking daughters to offer these clan less populations, in retune for their support.  The Clan leaders first sought to interbreed the primary prey of the hunters, the hardy Northland Boar, into their dwindling herds of the swine.  The plan would not come to fruition for many years, at which point the lineages of the clan which had intermarried with the hunters rose in prominence above the herders, who barely could maintain their lives, much less their status.  While the lineages that followed Lob grew in status, the gained little respect.  After facing hardship in their early years, they took bitter glee in extorting fellow tribe members for wealth and goods in exchange for sustenance. The shamans and priest of Lob grew isolated fro the tribal spiritual community, but did not desert the gods.  Many of the clan members did however, choosing to solely venerate the Tusked God. The faith did not disrespect or falter in supplicance to the pantheon, but the elements of the Lob became more prominent in the popular culture.  The hides, hooves, and teeth, especially the tusk became power symbols, and soon fetishes of the people.   When the Chlendi came, the people of Lob fought with the most resistance, as they had the most to lose.  After years of the struggle, ancient families had relearned the place n society, and finally regained lost status.  Locked in the servitude among the slave farmers was not the life for them. Their martial and hunting skills were hone for the struggled, but their lacked the numbers and initiative to mount a campaign against the Chlendi.  Instead the Clan broke off, and built small, mobile villages in the wilderness, slowly moving the southwest, and closer the expanding Mindat civilization.  They lost took with the hunt of the boar, and were forced to expand their forays to include other species.  Still the boar, and its lord, was their savoir and patron, saving them from starvation, extermination, and slavery.|

16|14|2003-02-14 16:00:32|widderslainte|Nation Summary: Balaconth|Capsule Summary: Balaconth  Balaconth is the shattered bits of a small coastal nation, bordered by the Lusnian Protectorates to the east, Nipend and mountains to the north, and once-contested Vensat lands to the west.  Balaconth was first settled as a few small city-states by Heteri lords a millenia or two ago. Only one of the cities, Akklai Point, exists as an occupied community today.  Balaconth has a mix of ethnic backgrounds, but Heteri dominates.  A wide range of religious practices are observed.  After the Eschlatli fell, Balaconth continued on as if nothing had happened.  They maintained the political and mercantile system as before, although on a smaller and more privatized scale.  Unfortunately it did not have the same benefits militarily, and slowly lost out to the burgeoning Commerce Guild in Vensat.  Subsequently, the subterranean goblin nation of Khoshinvak boiled forth from the caverns and overran Balaconth a few years ago.  When the invasion took place, balaconth consisted of a score of small villages, two cities, and a handful of decrepit or deserted forts.  It had no standing army, merely enough guards and mercenaries to maintain order.  Farmers and outlaws posed n resistance for the Goblin Queen's armies.  Today the nation is under the whims and desires of goblin queen, who remains safely underground.  There are from time to time outcropping of violent resistance, but they are largely unsuccessful.  In fact, the Khoshinvak only control the government and military, so for most of the peasants and lower class, life has changed little.|

17|17|2003-02-17 16:50:08|widderslainte|[Culture] The Mindat|The Mindat ('min-DOT') are the dark skinned peoples of the south, whose empire is said to have been founded thousands of years ago, Their presence in the Rhiat is normally limited to academic and magickal gatherings, and a number of their philosophers serve on the courts of nobles across the continent.  The Mindat are known to the people of the north for their invasion of the Heteri city-states hundreds of years ago, which led to the founding Ghikarn-naggai and development of the tradeports of Vensat, and the export of numerous varieties of smoking herbs, some which have addictive and dream-enhancing qualities.  The Mindat are also said to have brought slavery of nogs, small imp-like creatures, to the northern nations.  Religion - One thousand years ago, in the course of the conquest of the Rhiat, the Mindat worked great ceremonies binding their gods into corporeal forms use draining their essence to power rituals of destruction and transformation.  They now follow the teachings of the White Book, a philosophy claimed by its adherents to harness the power of divinity within.  The White Book has never been adequately translated out of it's native Mindat tongue.  Military - The Mindat are feared for their massive armies wielding long curved blades and protected by carapace armours.  They utilise cavalry mounted on riding lizards, and great reptilian war-beasts two or three stories high.   Important Cities: Amphishkiol, Idiaktuloi, Maniea Saghhit, and Khel.|

Prerequisites: Cast arcane spells, Constitution 9+, access to the Evocation School of Magic.   Benefits: As a normal action the charactre can make a ranged magical attack. The character must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit to a target. This attack uses the wizard's normal attack modifier, with a range 10 feet per level, and causes 1d4 points of damage on a successful hit. Any spell resistance that affects Evocation magic (including general spell resistance) offers complete protection from this attack. The mage bolt is considered a spell-like ability and requires enough concentration that it can be disrupted by a successful  attack (DC 10+damage). This ability has no somatic component beyond "throwing" the bolt and therefore is not limited by armor.   A Fetish (q.v.) is required for the use of the Bolt Arcane.   [Low Magic Variant] Bolts do 1d8 points of damage. After each use of the Bolt arcane the caster must make a Constitution Check.  Failure results in the temporary loss of one Constitution point (all points are recovered after a full night's rest).  A critical failure additionally causes the loss of one hit point.  The reduction of Temporary Constitution to 0 due to Bolt Arcane use results in unconsciousness, not death.|

26|26|2003-02-21 15:19:13|shawnbarrick <widderslainte@attbi.com>|[Nation] Vensat|VENSAT  Vensat is a small collection of coastal cities and towns on a peninsula south of Argaevaligne, where the Minkush River empties into the Sea of Storms.  Vensat City sits at this delta, and the city of Noduan is to the southwest at the tip of the peninsula.  Originally a collection of small Heteri fishing towns, the mouth of the river became a strategic point for the Mindat in their move north.  The communities developed as the Mindat took advantages of the fine inland timber and skills of the local shipwrights.  After the Mindat had retreated, Vensat became a nominal province under the Maetah/Chlendi alliance.  It became a major shipping and trade port to the communities of the south, and the favoured wintering spot of the Chlendi nobles.  Today Vensat is led by Chair-Governor Venras Ducat, who is appointed by the heads of the major merchant and noble houses.  Although the construction has a distinct Mindat influence, Vensat is a mix of cultures, ethnicities, and faiths.  Vensa, a pastiche of old Chlendi and Heteri, is the primarily language, but most townsfolk know enough of the major tongues to get by.|

After watching the city-states of their longtime Heteri foes crumble under the might of the Mindat reptilian cavalry, the Maetah were quick to subjugate themselves to the leadership of the Chlendi.  They made this pact in the presence of Esk, the Chlendi Spirit of Law and Truth, naming their alliance the Eschlatli, or "People of Righteousness".  They were able to stagnate the Mindat advance, and capture the lands now comprising Vensat, Nipend, Balaconth, and northern areas traditionally under Heteri control. The last remnants of the Eschalatli polity crumbled 200 years ago after the succession and independence of a culturally and geographically dispersed states.|

The N'Ka - dedicated to the study of psychology and the brain.  Uses bizarre adaptation of phrenology. Their practical focus is mysticism and Ushre Atam (Precept of Bliss).  They feel that traffic with spirits is dangerous and inefficient.  Their organization is on tolerable terms with the Church of Thedine. Scientologist/Mind control angle - push Noduan merchant council to work with alchemists. 6. The Slaving Lords - This religion believes that gaing adherents will increase the cult's control over the deity [spirit] himself.  Their magickal power is a product of their control and manipulation of the deity. The Slaving Cult was founded during the early days of the Eschlatli Empire, when tensions were still high between Maetah and Chlendi ethnic groups.|

50|50|2003-03-16 20:50:21|shawnbarrick|[Religion] Maetah Deity: Ubo|Ubo is the Maetah God of Wolves and Winter.  The sacred number of Ubo is 6, and he blesses are births of twins or triplets.  He is considered the son of Mustyoch and twin brother of Lob, God of the Boars.  Ubo's worship evolved from the beast cult of wolves and is the patron deity of hunters.  With the transistion of Argaevaligne to a monontheistic religion, his worship is official outlawed, but still cusually honoured in smaller towns and rural areas.  Shrines to Ubo are built in hunting blinds and markings left at the edge of woods and overgrown fields.  In olrd times, Ubo was honoured at the beginning of winter, and his shamans would emulate the hunting styles of packs of wolves in order for small tribes to survive the harsh winters of the northern Rhiat.  Ubo is still worshipped in Maetah lands outside of Argaevaligne, and in Ramush, Nipend, and parts of Ghikarn'ngai.  Only in rural or hunting communities do many dedicated priest exists, but his shrines are common.  Shrines and temples are built in great conical structures of stone, often covered in moss or sheets of peat in damp or colder climes.  The outside of the structure is hung with bones and skeletons of hunting kills usual deer or other large beasts.  Inside the shrine, a central fit bit is kept continually burning, even in the hotest months of the year.  Hunters and rural folk consider it unlucky to come across a shrine without the firepit burning, and will usually call off any hunts for the day and tend to the fire, even if the no priest actively monitors the shrine.  Priests of Ubo are usually skilled hunters, and often leaders in smaller towns or villages.  In tribal times, the priest of Ubo was the most valued advisor of the chief, and also skilled in the arts of war.    Priests dress in heavy white or grey robes or furs and wear jewelery from the teeth of wolves and other beasts.  Daily prayers are said at sunset each day, with no fixed weekly celebration.  His annual feast is upon the start of winter or first snowfall, when huge quanities of food are consumed with faith that Ubo will provide for the lean winter months.  Other worship activities include a fast the night before a great hunt, the donation of a leg of any kills to the priests, and the burnt sacrifice of the runt of the litter from any lairs found.|

52|52|2003-03-16 21:45:25|shawnbarrick|[Religion] Maetah - Eluus|[Religion] Maetah - Eluus  Eluus is the Maetah Goddess of Vegetation and Fertility.  Her colour is red, sacred number 4, and scared animal the goat.  In modern times she is seen as the source of the wild, chaotic, and dangers of the world by the priests of Aegaevaligne.  She is the siste of Ubo and Lob, and the adversary of Thedine.  Eluus is said the be the favoured child of Mustyoch, the God of Blood and Life.  Priests were almost always specifically devoted to Eluus, though they would inherit the duties of Lob or even Thedine if none of their devotees were present.  It was common for women, especially widows and those who lost their children to serve Eluus, and many would act healers and midwives for the village.  Women who were pregnant, hoping to become pregnant, or had ill children would keep an idol to Eluus hidden below their (or their sick child's) bed.  This is still in practice in Argaevaligne, as is the tradition of burying an idol below the ground upon a house is built.  Children born with red-hair are considered bless by Eluus and to bound for strength and good health.  Prayers to Eluus are said at dawn, and weekly worship is done before dawn at the beginning of the work week.  Annual feasts are held at the beginning of spring, midsummer, and at harvest time.  The central act of the spring celebration is for worshippers to have sex in their fileds the night before planting.  It is common for priesta and priestesses of Eluus to participate, usually in exhcange for an offering to the temple.  During the summer celebrations, sacrifices of a young calf are offered to the god, slaughtered by the local priest, and left in the ceter of fields to be devoured by birds.  If the whole carcass was gone by morning, the field was especially blessed by the goddess.|

55|55|2003-03-25 22:16:47|shawnbarrick|[Religion] Thedine & the Society of the Black Earth|Thedine & The Society of the Black Earth _______________________________________________________  Origin Nature  Sentient 	The Church sees Thedine as a sentient being with a stern,but even personality and a motivation in the best interest of all mankind.  This is not to be confused with love or compassion, as Thedine has little patience for apathy or sloth.  Followers speak of betraying the trust or dutyof Thedine, but not of Thedine's duty to them.  Origin Form  Entity 	Thedine is iconified as a blank faced elderly man.  His eyes are always prominent, but no other facial features are depicted.  Thedine is said to dwell upon a subterranean throne, but all devotees see this as metaphorical, and understand his true presence to extradimensional.  Origin Genesis  Created/Inherent      Although the creation of the spirit Thedine in this sphere is well documented in Chlendi spiritualist lore, the High Argaevalignian Church of Thedine maintains that the world was created through the sweat and blood of Thedine the Eternal.  Origin Connections  Related      The Chlendi maintain that Thedine is but one of a thousand and one spirits, but rose to prominence through the devotion of a nation.  The Church teaches that other deities and spirits are evil demons, which seek to lead mankind to sloth and deceit.  Origin Orientation  Balanced 	Although there are no records of appearances or concrete manifestations, followers see the hand of Thedine is subtle daily measures.  His struggles against the demons of drought, cold, and storm perserve the land of the Maetah.  Origin Relations  Interested (Control)  While it is clear that Thedine takes an interest in the actions of his minions, his true motivations are unclear.   The Society of the Black Earth  The Society of the Black Earth is the primary institution of professional servants of Thedine.  The 'black earth' comes from the Maetah term jhapitim, meaning fertile soil (which was black soil).  The Society is comprised of the priests, professional laypersons, and support staff of the High Argaevalignian Church of Thedine.  It is an official body of the Church, and also a recognized office of the Argaevalignian government.  Because of the state's theocratic government, many bureaucrats and military personnel receive positions in the Society, but on a lesser level, it also includes that maintain staff at temples and shrines.  The Society of the Black Earth is the descendent of a lineage of a Maetah lineage, qod-Jhapitim, which comprised the core of the Thedine priesthood among the early North Sea Coast villages.    As Chlendi forces moved into the regions, their strategists focused on dominating the local populations, which would make excellent agricultural laborers.  They felt that by controlling the primary religious leadership, the persons whom received the most respect, and thus had most influence, the populace could be thus controlled.  This method would turn to be most effective among the Maetah because of the primacy of the agricultural faith in the economy and livelihood of the culture.  The Chlendi thus conspired with the clan, who by virtue of having the most power among the Maetah, also had the most to lose in the conquest. In exchange for the agricultural surplus and support of the social order, the qod-Jhapitim was allowed to stay in power as puppets of the Chlendi.|

56|56|2003-03-25 22:43:53|shawnbarrick|[Magick] Sorcery|Sorcery  Definition - Sorcery is the general art of changing the reality in conformity with desire.  Hedge magicians among the Maetah first developed the techniques commonly associated with modern Tezrhait sorcery.  Because of its decentralized, individualistic development, the discipline went uncodified, and rather under-theorized for hundreds of years.  When the Maetah people were enslaved as manual laborers for the Chlendi, the mystics and academicians, among them sought to master and understand the Maetah sorcery.  Subsequently, the standard terminology and theory of sorcery exists in the vocabulary of the Chlendi tongue.  Historical and Cultural Background ---------------------------------- Origin Nature  Non sentient  Origin Form  Essence  Origin Genesis  This origin was originally the creator deity of the Maetah pantheon, Amrikol.  During the mythic period, Amrikol was confronted and destroyed by his family, the majority of the other members of the pantheon. Alternate versions of the mythology tell that the pantheon sacrificed Amrikol to give life to humanity, or that Amrikol sacrificed himself to do so, in spite of the pantheon.  Regardless, upon his death, his essence infused the world, giving thought, emotion, and sentience to humanity, and infusing many item and species with his omnessence.  By giving this power to humanity and the world, trained practitioners could access the power of divinities without the need for pacts and grants.  Origin Relations  Ultimately related, but the omnessence forged from Amrikol could not be accessed in any other fashion.

The most famous and effective sorcerers have left behind an intellectual tradition through generation after generation of students, similar to the academies of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle.  These are named after the founding mage.  Other schools develop around a group, or faculty of teaching sorcerers, who specialize in a few of these methods or arcane knowledges.|

61|61|2003-04-07 22:20:33|shawnbarrick|[City] Bolog|Bolog   Ancient Heteri community at the base of Moniin peaks at one of the ends of the Cuvauw Pass.  The hills behind the small city are lined with caves and tunnels and contain the Grand Temple of Hilinavyu.  It is ruled by the Viwhul ('king' or 'chief') Solok of the Smoking Thunder, who is descended from the Luggai Heteri tribes.  His only daughter was to marry the lord of Akklai Point, but was killed during the goblin invasion.  Solok is fiercely independent of both the Ghikarn'gai revolts and the goblins, and has close ties with the Temple of Hilinavyu to this end.  Bolog maintains good relations of Argaevaligne, Cuvauw, and other independent communties in Balaconth.  The city of Bolog is a sprawling mess, with neigborhoods running up and down the hills, with towers lining the highest peaks.  In honour of the city's patron, Hilinavyu, great coal braziers are lit of hillstops and city walls during every new moon, as well as the feats of god.  Its ancient inner gates are lined with huge boulder rlled down from the hills, upon which chunks of iron slag and molten were thrown to cool. The populace is predominately Heteri, although there are no extensive clan presence outside that of Smoking Thunder.  Even in other ethnic neighborhoods, Heteri style clan markers are used upon gates and entranceways.  Given the predominance of Hilinavyu and worship of the rest of the Heteri pantheon, the city is remarkably tolerant of other faiths, though the small Thedine presence is limited to insular churches.|

62|62|2003-04-07 22:42:43|shawnbarrick|[City] Givos|Givos   Coastal town, traditionally disputed by Balaconth and the rulers of Teldarpha.  Currently occupied by the Goblin Queen's forces, it is ruled by 'Mivuhwul' Isasnias Koman, the middle-aged burgher of a upper class family who act as puppets to the local goblin Captain Nivinak.  Isasnias demonstrated his loyalty by killing the previous Mivuhwul in the city square.  Givos, for unknown reason, was on the first communties targetd when the goblins came surfaceside.    Despite the crumbling walls and downtrodden residents, Givos stills welcomes travellers and merchants, so long they keep clear of the Goblin occupying force.  Discreet travellers can find same loding at the White Witch inn, two blocks in the from east gate.  The Sorceror's House of Duslangarot is still active, but only with a skeleton staff.  They are said to be in the good graces of the Goblin Queen.  The city is a mix of Eslka and Heteri ethnicities, and most building are small houses of stone and peat, able to withstand the stormy summer season.|

63|63|2003-04-13 22:00:15|shawnbarrick|The Minkush River Valley |Minkush River Valley  ---------------------  The Minkush River is the major waterway in northern Rhiat, running north-south from the Swamps of Ramush to Vensat City, where it empties into the Sea of Storms.  The river valley was the central regionof the Eschlatli Empire, and still connects most of the influential cities of the egion to this day.  It marks the border between Ramush and Argaevaligne, as well as the spheres of influence of Vensat and Balaconth.   Barony of Minkarraph -------------------- The Barony was orginally a province of the Eschlatli Empire, and previously a colony of the Maetah along the Red Coast inlet of the Minkush River.  The Maetah (Early Archaevaligne) peoples found cleared space and plentiful building materials left by the ruins of the ancient Heteri city, Gezar.  For decades the early settlers fought with the native Geblumin tribe, believed to be of Heteri descent, who lived in small villages in the hills lining the river valley.  Minkaraph became the capitol of the Eschlatli at their prime, and was ravaged and rebuilt during warfare with the Mindat.  Pugshlow  -------- Pugshlow is a small fishing and trade port in the remote swamps of Ramush.  It's still a tradtional Chlendi community in most respects, and the home of notable shamans and devotees of the old spirits.  Pugsshlow is the jump point to a cave-ridden hill seen as a holy shrine to many adherents.  Asklor ----------------------- Old Chlendi capitol.  Moved to Minkarapht after reformation into Eschlatli Empire.  Held the culture's great scholarly institutions, home to schools of sorcery as well as the National Observatory for the Clan of the Blue Moon, who traditionally headed the Astrolgoger's Guild.  The city was built far from waterways or exiting communities to mine a deposit of the sacred amberite, which was dug out from beneath the city itself, within it's towering walls.  Although the city is now only sparsely populated, mining continues to this day.  Pasdani ------- Built at the head of the Minkush River.  The river drains a small lake which has coalesced from the flow of the swamps.  A grand brigeg was constructed during the founding of the Eschlatli Empire, named for General Photil, who crushed the remaining settlements of Chlendi resistence.  The villages fought the establishment fo the the Black Lily Crown, and saw it as a dissolution of the Chlendi blood and mystical heritage.  Since the secession of the Duke of Ramush, it the bridge has been the center of open hostilities between the nations, and is now the capitol of Ramush.   Imphomonee  ----------- Imphomonee is built around a set of prodigious waterfalls, which netured to potential trade power of the MInkush River.  The city guards a series of locks, canals, and portages developed to control and overcome the geographical limitations. Cutting-back, tiered roads leads up the hill on the west-side of the falls from the lower to the upper city.  The city militia's citadel sites at the base of the hill, regulating all traffice between the quarters.  To the east, a series of towers are built upon outcrops from the cliff-face. Along the upper quarter a massive wall stretches along either side of the Minkush.  The remnants of an archway reach precariously across the river from the estern side, and towers dot the wall every 50 yards.    Jegelumuth  ---------- City originally carved from the side of the cliffs as a Ningala fortress.  Conquered by the Chlendi at the opening of the 2nd Epoch as their first act of war against the Heteri and their allies.  The city has an open series of mines which drain into the Minkush, and yield copper ore and amberite, an amber coloured crystal favoured by the Chlendi.  Vensat City ----------- Capitol of the nation of Vensat.  The most powerful trading city in the Rhiat, and home the greatest shipwrights of the Storm Sea.  Residents see the city as the center of culture and fashion of Rhiat, and strive to keep the travellers and sailors the mob the port out of their pristine inner quarter.     Minor Communities ----------------- Minkushtown - small rivertown between Vensat and Minkaraph Ikulyhu - promient at the end of the first Epoch of Rhiat.  Located along the modern border of Argaevaligne, near the North Sea Coast. Gloamingport- Small port town on the North Sea coast.|

66|66|2003-04-14 11:55:51|shawnbarrick|[Nation] Ramush|The Duchy of Ramush  Brief  The Duchy of Ramush is the last bastion of pure Chlendi culture in Rhiat.  The nation survives despite vigous aggression by the Argaevaligne from its inception, surviving merely be its position along the major water route between Vensat and the North Sea and its control over notable mountain passes.  The Ramushian culture has grown and mutation from its Chlendi roots and insular nature as a peculiar adaptation of the specialized nation.  Its arts, philosophy, and theology and a sliver of traditional Chlendi civilization a millenia ago, and its agriculture, material culture, and diet have warped in response to the limited resources of the swamps.  Geography  Primarily swamp along central valley corridor as Minkush River diverges into north sea.  The geography also suffers form the water runoff from both the central Maldaer Plateau to the east and the mountains to the west.  Ethnicity The Duchy has a mix of Eskla blood and its two components: Maetah & Chlendi.  Those of Maetah blood are usually slaves orlower class, and Chlendi purity is valued for Religious and political positions.  Who Rules The Duchy.  It is a republic by constitution, but the leaders still hold feudal titles of Duke and Baron.  Who Really Rules Duke Zihragris of Pasdani.  While he holds equal sway officially, the othr dukes and barons generally defer to his opinions.  Communities Cities - Asklor, Pasdani Towns - Pugshlow, Gloamingport  Religion This region is officially open to all religions.  But from the cause and date of its formation, the Duchy has been run by, and used as a haven for, religions often fobidden elsewhere.  The strongest of these factions are: Mustyoch and Hilinavyu of the traditional Maetah pantheon, and a number of Chlendi spirits.  Language North Common is the tongue of the region, but most residents know a smattering of other languages due to the variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds in the state.   Currency None officially, but the crown of Archival is most often seen.  Ancient Chlendi Empire coinage is also highly prized, and can often be used openly (and for a price higher than its antiquarian worth).  History Ramush was once the western county in Argaevaligne, established as a frontier along the hills and swamps.  When the Society of the Black Earth began intensive missionary action in the county, they discovered that the budding towns had already been infested by the priests and adherents of other, 'unsavory' faiths.  With support of the Argaevalignian crown, they mounted an inquisition in the region, but underestimated the relevance of these blasphemous faiths.  The priest faced a revolt amongst the peasantry, and called in military force.  While the military endeavor was successful in communities closest to the Argaevalignian heartland, the settlements of Ramush County simply spread into the swamps and hills.  The county borders were then revised to only include the retaken communities, and the King and priesthood assumed the border communites and decay without royal support.  They were wrong.|

67|67|2003-04-15 21:20:04|shawnbarrick|The Fog|Sailors of the Sea of Storms warn of The Fog, great masses of yellowish vapours that hover over the sea to the south and west.  They appear out of nowhere and stretch for hundreds of miles, and are more common as one approaches the shores of the ShnKvaruth. The Shn are said to h9old the secret to navigating The Fog, and only passed it on to a trusted few outside their species.  A sect has grown up around these teachings, calling themselves the Ferrymen, and command great prices for any travel far from the shores of Vensat, Ghikarn'gai and other lands of the south.|

70|70|2003-04-21 19:12:54|shawnbarrick|[Culture] Chlendi|Not as complete as I hoped, but it should suffice for now.   The Chlendi -----------  The Chlendi are a frail olive skinned people who came by sea to the northern coast of Rhiat around 2500 years ago.  They were well acutomed to the swamps and damp forests that fed the mouth of the Minkush River and were content to build small villages for their first few centuries.  The histories read that the leader was the younger son of the distant royal family, and came here to start his own kingdom, and claim title as the wearer of the "Black Lily Crown".  The people organized into small familial clans, most worshipping a few patron spirits.  The most prominent of the still extant clans are: Mourning Legions, Everlasting Bog, Spider Trees, Marble Hammer, Bronze Blade, Violet Glory, Noble-light-people, and Mottled Bull.  They spread south to conquer Heteri tribe in what is now Vensat, and had many decades of conflict with the Maetah.  The Chlendi enslaved whole towns of Maetah peasants as laborers, and eventually united with other populations of both Heteri and Maetah against the advance of the Mindat.  The massive bureaucracy could not maintain a network of such diversity, and began splintering before it could reach a millennia of age, as smaller cstates and split began self-governence in their own interest.  Nowadays small villages of Chlendi dot the western Rhiat, but the only significant populations are found in Ramush.  However the clans are reuniting in other larger cities and seeking out their heritage in the swamps and misty hills of the north.  In ancient times, the Chlendi lived off the swamps, eating shellfish, snakes, swamprats and fowl.  Philters and herbal concontions were made the from the plants and fungi.  A potent incense from the toxic black algae was used to conjure spirits.     Religion & Magick -----------------  Chlendi cosmology describes the creation of the world as an Ex Nihilo event in the universe.  At the time of creations spirits from across the planes and universe wrre drawn to the infant sphere.  The formation of the spehere created lines of omnessesence (similar to ley lines) between the Rhiat and (the continental region) and other stars,  The confluence of these lines formed around the constellatins, creatng numerous gates, engulfing and transporting spirits to the sphere.  The Chlendi were polytheists and animists in the broadest sense.  Spirits were everywhere and in everything.  Priests and shamans wrote encylopediac theologies and hierarchies, noting spirits of various powers.  Some were worshiped as nearly deific, why others were ectoplasmic slaves to be ordered about by any within and inkling of magickal skill.  The Chlendi bury their dead in subterranean tombs of stone.  Because this is not practical in the swamps, indivudals are submerged and covered in cairns of stone, often nearby deceased family members.  Chlendi faith posits that the dead dweel amongst the spirits, ofetn working for them in the spirit realm.  The most reknown of Chlendi mystics and warriors people objects of worship themselves. Ancestors and favoured spirits are idolized in small clay or metal figures that are kept at home or carried by travellers.    They mastered the arts of summoning and astrology building shrines along veins of mystical ores.  Their most prized material is amberite, a golden translucent rock which is carved into jewelry, idols, and other religious object.  Material Culture -------------------------- The staple of traditional Chlendi garbed is a colourful perfumed turbin.  The scent is engineered to hide the musk of the swamp as well as repel the abundent insects.  The colors are a matter of fasion, and the pin or broach holding it in place is the most prominent symbol of ones economic status.  In the swamps, most homes and small buildings are raised platforms on stilts, with wooden structure and thatched roof.  Large building are constructed and large stone plazas which rise out of the water and level off swampy ground.  The original homeland of the Chlendi did not have horses, and with most of their communities in the wetlands, it was rarely pratical to adopt them.  In the swamp variety of flatt bottom boats and skiffs are used for personal and commodity transport, the largest of which are pulled by ibisis, a species of larged tamed amphbious beasts.|
71|71|2003-04-25 16:36:13|shawnbarrick|[Magick] Ritual of the Black Bile|Ritual of the Black Bile [Necromancy]  Believe the have been brought north by Mindat sorcerors, the Ritual of the Black Bile was popular amongst the lower class in Vensat, Minkarraph, and urban regions of Balaconth in the 24th through 26th centuries.  Still in use today, the ritual requirtes the subject to be strapped or chain down to a table or other surface while undergoing a painful extraction.  The ritual collects the hate, anger, and agression stored up within a person and distills it into a thick black liquid.  The liquid is bottled up for later use, and is viable as long as the subject suffers thepain of the ritual.  Upon contact with the skin, the liquid burns like acid, taking out all of the creator's emotion on body and soul of the victim.|


72|72|2003-05-20 14:46:34|shawnbarrick|[City] Cuvauw|Cuvauw is a small city that sits at the edge of the hills south of Argaevaligne, where the head of the Eastward waters leaves the mountains.  A few small fishing villages and towns line the river downstream to Minkarraph.  High in the mountains, yet protected from the brutal North Sea storms, Cuvauw was a favoured summering spot for the noble and wealthy at the height of the Eschlatli Empire.  The town was originally built to support a mining colony, whose endeavors still produce great wealth in ores and gems for the region.  With the Goblin invasion to the south Cuvauw has become the largest free community in Balaconth, and consequently harbors many noble families of the region, and is building a sizable military presence to defend them.  Cuvauw is ruled by Comte Mlash Revuud, cousin of the 'King' of Nipend, and is widely thought to be stern but just.  He is advised by the sage Ocurod, and his uncle, a priest of Thedine.  Ocurod is known as acolyte of Ri-Ephond (Lord of the Earth), the traditional patron deity of Cuvauw.  In recent years, rumour has is that the Comte is merely following the orders of his brother Duke Naffan, a former ruler of Balaconth now in exile from the Goblin Invasion.    Cuvuaw straddles the streams and falls the join just outside the city walls and run west through the midst of the city.  Docks, market squares, and small canals line the waterway, as well as a central bridge that leads north to the palace, militia barracks, and fortified mine entrances.  Two great towers from the smelting houses tower over the southern side and the sit and their plumes of smoke can be seen from miles away.  Butchering, timbering, and other industries reside in the Southern Ward as well and much of the lower class housing.  Other notes: Cuvauw is the nearest city to Argaevaligne, but the Church is not a major player in the city.  The Comte's uncle is a priest, but not his closest advisor.  The idea of noble (and wealthy) families retaking their rightful lands from the Goblin Queen falls in line with the Church's ethics.  The Jeweler's Guild has always wanted a piece of the action in Cuvauw.  They control the luxury goods trade in the major coastal cities and along the Minkush River.  In Cuvauw they have to go through a few middlemen, seriously cutting into the potential profit. They are heavily opposed by the Commerce Guild.  All these noble titles are remnants of when the Eschlatli Empire unified most of the Rhiat, and are stilled passed on hereditarily.  Dukes, Barons, Viscounts etc hold title and land, but there is no king or feudal structure over them.  They all lord over small city-state (or less!), but fight for status with $$$.  Back in the days of the Empire, Cuvauw was the Aspen or Cape Cod of the region, where all the families would go to marry their children off to other noble families.  Many still do this, usually in an attempt to consolidate their power.  In the case of the Comte, his only son is currently tucked away in the local asylum.|

It's a rather seedly looking, decrepit place, but safe due to it's proximity to nicer parts of town.  Members of the upper class patronize late at night when "slumming it", or looking for pleasures not found in nicer establishments.  The tavern has a leaky wine cellar available for private meetings or large groups.|

105|105|2003-07-08 16:39:43|shawnbarrick|[Magick] Traditions|Magick is thought of as 'pratical philosphy' in most of Uod.  The term 'sorcerer' is used in conjuction with the general casting of spells, while terms such as alchemist, apothecary, and dweomercrafter may be used for those who magick focuses on items.    In the minds of most scholars and practictioners, there is not a strict Arcane/Divine division.  Anyone with a theoretical bent recognizes various sources for the energy: the dream realm, calentures, the ether, the far planes, various forms of hard omnessence, spirits, and other empyrean entities.  How distinct the sources are depends on who you ask.  At the height of the Empire, most formal sorcerers were trained in academies and small retreats.  Much like Greek philosophers, they would take on the tradition and style of their master.  Notable traditions still taught today include: Azan, Bluemoon, Ghaerdon,  Coranth, Hastille, Torfaine, Merduer, and Duslangarot.|

110|110|2003-07-15 12:08:42|shawnbarrick|Clans |Clans are a common social unit in most of the Rhiat (the northern continient of Uod).  The stereotypical "clan" was the basic social unit amonst the Chlendi people.  When the Empire solidified, the lower class Maetah peoples emulated the style to gain political power.  The Heteri people have traditionally had a similar structure though it's more a combination of ancestor idolotry and large extended families.    Older and wealthier clans have "clanhouses" and similar group structures.  In some cases these are old inhereted manors, while some are a medieval version of the VFW.  Merchant clans office have office structures or warehouses.  If you are in good standing with your clan, you can get lodging and a nice warm meal in a strange town.  If you stay for more than a weekend, they will put you to work.  Donating goods and service to the clan can gain you honour and power, but elders may also call on you for tasks.  Clanhouses and private homes of respectable memebers often have clan markers, which come in regional styles, but always have some identifying aspects of the clan, its heraldry, or cultural elements.

Creation of the talisman requires 1000 GP and 100 XP per level of spell it can link, and can only ever be linked to one spell.

Wizards (and academics) among the Mindat are the only ones allowed to wear white robes.  There are also identifiable by a flat-brimmed, almost bowler-style, hat.  A proper Mindat wizard would be schooled in alchemy, a yoga-like form of meditation, the creation of amulets and talismans, and communication with spirits.'  'As someone of non-Mindat descent it's doubtful they'd give you access to all their methods, or that you completed your training while among them.  Some of the particular methods require oaths and religious obligations (The White Book, the Way of the Flesh) that may not jive with your character anyways.'|

113|113|2003-07-15 15:39:29|shawnbarrick|Clan Markers|Clan owner structures and home of priminent members typically have clan markers at the entrance to the property.  Heteri - carved wooden totems, the tops of which are hollowed depressions for torches or lit pitch.  Chlendi - two forms.  The simpler (lower-class) clan marker are small cairns on either side of the entrance, often with the clan symbol or other heraldry painter or carved into the largest rock in the cairn.  More elaborate markers include a massive arch, much like the dream arches in their mythology.  Cairns are still formed around each leg of the arch.  Maetah - Maetah clan markers are in the form of a sigle pillar or obelisk.  The pillar is drapped with a banner engraved with runes decsribing the clans role or history.

A thousand years ago, Mindat sorcerors evoked their deities into corporeal form and ritually slayed them, using their energies to power great magicks.  They see themselves as free of "slavery" to extraplanar beings seek to harness their powers within.  The White Book is a guide to this process.  It has never been adequeted translated out of the Mindat language, and while quoted frequently, is never read aloud.  It describes a process and trails of harnessing one's soul, which is called "walking the labyrinth".  The book itself is bound in white leather and is upwards of 400 pages. Many of the pages, or parts of the pages are left blank to be filled in by the adherent recording his progress or completing exercises.|

A natural ridge, supplemented with mounds of trash, has become a combination borrowing den and apartment-complex for the Nogs of Cuvauw. Nogs are short, humanoid race of varied shapes and proportions.  Most have a tan or light brown complexion, and two proortionate sets of limbs.  Hair is rare, and facial features tend be extreme - very bulbuous, or pointd and fine.  Height ranges from 2 to 4 feet, and weight varies from rail-thin to barrel-gutted. The community is losely ruled by "King" Fround.  The nogs themselves are nearly slaves to the human population. Many indentured servants and actual slaves work in the noble villas, while others man poor quality fields outside the city walls.  A few lucky nogs are "free" and work as labourors and petty assistants in the area.  The free nogs, having the most money of the bunch, build ramshackle huts on Nog Hill, only to be overtaken but the next lucky nog with an influx of coin or building material.  This has leed constrction on Nog Hill to tower higher and higher, with frequent accidents due to the complete lack on engineering skill.|

The hill beasts, a variety of mongel beastmen, would be hunt with great blackpowder weapons and packs of hounds.  Since Cuvauw's decline, the hill beasts have rebuilt their number and their tribal orginazation.  Few trappers go into hills alone and return.  The Amp An old arena down by the river, this structure was built at the height of the Empire for gladatorial games, performances, and ceremonies.  Now largely abandoned and crumbling, the arena is the home of a slipshod unorganized martketplace.  The Earl's Dead Fish With a name derived from the punchline of a joke no one longer remembers, this fine tavern is the establishment that all up and coming society members don't want their parents to see them at.  Located upsteam from the Amp in the stifling heat of the furnaces, The Earl's Dead Fish offers a variety of local cuisine, along with drinks and pleasures from across the Rhiat.  The proprietor, Minaan, is said to a heretic wanted by the Mindat, who still offers prayers and trinkets to his dead gods in a shrine behind the taproom.  ---------------- These will be added to the revised version of the Cuvauw pdf my tomorrow.|

This should give you an idea of commons sounds for creating names.  - Pantheons.pdf: Only has a summary of the Heteri gods.  I can provide more specific information as needed.  They are generally worshipped as a pantheon, though particular gods are especially venerated, i.e. warriors might have a small shrine to Utan the Destroyer.  General appearence: The Heteri are burly sun-browned people with long, curly hair, and dark eyes.  They wear clothing of hide, skin, and wool, ornamented with beads, feathers, teeth, and scraps of fur.  In more cosmopliton arenas, the same fashion persists, but with finer tailoring, and polished stones and finer furs as ornamentations.  Traditional head covering is an embroidered leather hood, which wraps around the neck or chest as a sash or scarf.  Social Organaization: Heteri are patrilinean and patrilocal.  In rural areas they are gather as "tribes" which are equivalent to clans in other cultures.  In larger urban settlements, tribes may settle into neighborhoods, honoring the Vuhwul (chief) locally unless there is a Heteri King.  All of the tribes/clans trace their lineage back to one of the "original tribes": Luggai, Naggai, and Polog are the most famous.  It is divisions between these groups that is the basis for the civil war in Ghikarn'gai.|

Hmm.  That's a good question.  I don't know if there is a language per se.  There may be a ritual tongue, but I think Old Chlendi is used for that.  For game purposes, you can put down "Spirit Tongue" for now.  That should cover all the bases, and almost be skill in the art of communication.  Most communicate on a telepathic level (like mediums), or in a common language depending on the spirit's origin.|

How common are honorifics or  > other appilations?  Are there any name conventions to  > indicate social status or gender?   Traditionally, it would be, 'Firstname of Clan_Name'.  Among other Heteri, the Tribal affiliation (Polog, Luggai, etc) would be known from the Clan Name.  If you were of noble lineage, you might just say 'Firstname, son of Fathername', as any proper person would recognize the name of your father.    In more modern times, the clans have larger settled and because of some intermixing, some will use 'Firstname Lastname of Cityname' instead of the clan name.  Last names are a convention adopted from other cultures.  In Cuvauw, they'd be sued by a lot of Heteri.  In Ghikarn'gai, they only care about your clan.  Vuhwul = Tribal Chief or King Mivehwul = Mayor or Clan Head  The Heteri aren't too formal beyond that.  They would use terms like Elder (for age and respect) and Sir (for politeness or unfamiliarity), but I don't know that I have specific Heteri words for those.  Women don't hold title, but would still be respected, and might call them selves "Firstname, son of Fathername" (yes, son) is their father was a chief.  There aren't specific vowels used in female names, but I'll try to come up with lists of common names for each gender.|

It appears to be of natural causes, but a sorcerer of foreign descent was seen at his manorhouse earlier that evening.  Rumours that a great winged beast flew into his bedroom have been dismissed as idle nog-gossip.  - Agents of the Society of Black Earth are reporting flying overnight to oversee the Baron's funeral, which will folow the traditions of the Maetah & Church of Thedine.  - Wearing of weapons and armour.  In towns are urban areas sheathed knives and swords are tolerated on the streets, but may be frowned upon in some establishments.  Military weapons (crossbows, polearms) will draw the attention of authorities unless one appears to be part of the local militia on constabulatory.  Armour heavier than a chain shirt will draw suspicion.  Think of entering a nice restuarant in a wifebeater and boxer shorts, or carrying around a chainsaw in a shopping mall.  Generally you'll find these dictates stricter to the south, and more lenient in the east.  In most cases drawing a blade is considered a sign of intent.  - Titles in Northern Rhiat.  Most of the noble title were gained during the Echlatli Empire.  Through marriage and conquest many of these have been transfered, and their modern usage is maintained primarily as a status symbol for the bearer.  While civil leadership (such a the mayor of a town or city) often coincides with noble title, they are not typically one and the same.  Still most holding noble title usually still have a significant amount of land, and often wealth and power to match.

This power is channeled through the entity at the time of use.  The means to access this omnessence varies.    - Bequest: Energy or powers invested in agent.  Requires no contact with the entity at the time of use.  This includes pacts with extraplanar beings.  - Physical: Omnessense which natutally occurs in biological or mineral sources.  Most often the item is destroyed in the process of releasing or using the energy.  This includes 'material components', alchemy (in some forms), herbalism, prana, and human/animal sacrifice.  Well-versed sorcerers can view the inherent prana in items or people in a process similar to aura reading.  The magickally gifted actively exhibit a nimbus of omneessence.  - Geological: There is power to be found in nature.  Chlendi mystics have hypothesized that "ley lines" follow the vein of the amberite mineral beneath the ground.  Others have harvested power given off by geysers, volcanos, and othe geological phenomena.  - Inherent: Although all living creatues have prana to some extent, others are possessed with power to another degree, or have been trained to focus what we all possess.  A cult, "The Children of the Highest", believe they are the descendents of mortal-divine reproduction.  Others such as the followers of the White Book, see all sentient beings are possessed with a "divine spark" which can honed through the training and meditation upon one's 'higher self'.  - Created: Rituals are known which create a type of humunculous called a 'fetch' which retrieve formulae and effects from across planes and dimensions.  Fetch are oftenb mistaken for familiar amongst the uneducated.|

People speak of the death of Vumenhai, descendent of the ancient Heteri King Vuhai who was reported kill in this areaby Chlendi tracks centuries ago. Legend has it that he was fleeing Jegelumuth with a few Ningala slaves when he was struck down by Chlendi spirit beasts alogn the river.  - A groundskeeper reports that a white stag was found drown in the pond behind the Comte's manorhouse the night before the Baron died. A foul omen according to the Night Texts, a collection of ancient Heteri divination.  - Dispute has already begun about the change in prestation within the city.  Lords from the houses of Thive and Guffan were spotted dueling as the funeral procession for Baron Ilwaen left town.  One of the seconds inthe affair was found floating in the river, but the whereabouts of the other principals is not known.  - Streetlamps in the Noble and Merchant quarter of Cuvauw were left dark on the night of the Baron's funeral.    People & Places -------------- - Barony of Minkarraph: Barony was orginally a province of the Eschlatli Empire, and previously a colony of the Maetah along the Red Coast inlet of the Minkush River.  The Maetah (Early Archaevaligne) peoples found cleared space and plentiful building materials left by the ruins of the ancient Heteri city, Gezar.  For decades the early settlers fought with the native Gebulmin tribe, believed to be of Heteri descent, who lived in small villages in the hills lining the river valley.   Local Colour ------------- - The Cauldron - If you should be unlucky enough to wander the back alleys of Cuvauw's south end at night you may run into a few thugs from this "family business".  The Cauldron, nicknamed for founder Elias Cauldrobun, were the dominate criminal organization in town a few decades ago, but have now begun hiring new muscle and taken to new market in response to recent competition.  Be careful - they no longer just want your purse.  - Gít: a major crop in the central Rhait.  Git grows in moist areas; river valleys and swampy land.  It is planted in mid spring, and grows to full height in early to mid summer (late June).  At maturity it has large corn-like stalks, which sprout multiple ears.  The git ears are covered with large numbers (100-200) of red-brown, soft fluffy grains.  These grains have a natural texture similar to cooked rice.  Common preparation is the boil the git, which rapidly reaches a thick, gruelish, consistency.|

Expiditions founded by those traditionalists who fought the reign of Voyiditl of the Lily Crown, battled their way through the terrors of the hills into the blasted plains to the west.  They founded towns and fortresses at the edge of the sandy steppes that were dotted with the towers of exiled Mindat sorcerors.  When the plagues struck through the Chlendi, the colonies had no access to the traditional herbal cures known in the jungles and swampy lands.  The infected legions journeyed west to the coastal palace-kingdom of Jibido, but were turned away in fear.   Culture ------- Aside from Jibido, small villages of Chlendi and Eskla blood still exist.  Most subside on herds of animals, and the few crops which grow in the rocky, dry soil.  The economy is primarily barter through exchange of food and labour.  Whiel they might recognize the coins for foreign lands, gold and silver are of little use here.  A small roster of spirits are honoured, and most Chlendi credit them for their continued survival.  Important Cities ---------------- Jibido - City of Mindat founded at the point of the Western Peninsula of the Rhiat.  Prison colony built to oversee the exiled priests and sorcerors.  The Mindat feared executing those who possessd great calentures from the old gods.

Trees surrounding the hillside path burst into flame and smoke enveloped the group as bestial "hill people" charged into the line of mourners.  Taking cover, our game warden Rikuu began firing arrows at the advancing beasts, taking a nasty slice to the gut in the process.  Viktor fired his pistol and sliced on the beasts trying to take control of the wagons.  Ever-bold Nisik crawled to a "strategic position" beneath the wagons and set upon chanting arcane prayers to the spirits.  Valiant militiamen fired their rifles in the hordes and tried to hold them off as the nobles and townspeople fled back to town.  The wagon drivers has to axe blows and bizarre spasm-inducing tentacles.  Quickly it became apparent. that the "hill people" had more in mind than just chaos and bloodshed.  They were after the Baron's casket.  After hacking and firing they're way to the front wagon, and downing a few foes, it's discovered that the true beats the Rikuu has grown to hate, but a few dozen bandits in rags and hide masks.  After a few idle threats, the leader reveals that they were hired by a man at the Shell & Cup tavern to disrupt the procession and steal the Baron's corpse without bringing much harm to the nobles.    The band took a few captives and the Baron's corpse to meet Fulwen, the Baron's Majordomo, who was secreted away at the hospital (read 'asylum').  They planned to delay the funeral proceedings by telling the priests that the hill people had run off with the Baron's corpse, so they could keep it for further study.  Fulwen had discovered records that another shipment of the mysterious herbs would be arrived the next day for the Baron, and planned to meet with the merchants involved.  Meanwhile, they would ambush Chivat, the man who hired the bandits for the corpse-napping.  Vanos, the morally-challenged administrator of the asylum seemed all-too-happy to provide a vegetative inmate and a copy of brawny truncheon-wielding "assistants" to aid in the ambush.  They stowed the vegetable in place of the Baron's corpse and headed to the Boneyard.  Rikuu took a vantage point among the tombs, as the rest of the group approached the meeting spot, masquerading as bandits in the beast masks.  After negotiations begin to stall, Nisik felled a few thugs which an incantation, Rikuu bulleye's a shot into Chivat's chest.  Chivat conjures a heavy fog and retreats, as Viktor and the thugs advance in hopes of capturing the leader.  Viktor subdues him, but not before a thug falls to the ground, his face mangled from an unknown cause.  The other thug panics and flees but is dropped by a wounding pistol shot from Viktor.  They bind the wounds of Chivat, and retreat to the subbasement of the asylum.  After some interrogation, Chivat reveals they've been watching the Baron and feared him research into the spirit world.  He and fellow cultists of Mustyoch feared without proper binding rituals, the cremation of the corpse would release fell spirits into the world.  Chivat himself is not sure the details of the of Baron's researches, but know he was conducting rituals at a hunting lodge in the hills.  Before the Chivat could be questioned further, he began hacking and coughing.  A foot long white worm erupted from his mouth and scuttled along the floor.  After some jumping and smashing the worm was killed and thrown into a jar of preservative fluid.  Chivat passed out, and the group began to formulate further plans.|

186|186|2003-11-23 14:28:38|shawnbarrick|A Note on Maetah Clans|A bit of clarification on Maetah kinship.  The Maetah traditionally did not have clans in the sense of Heteri and Chlendi social organization.  They tied ancestry to direct lines, rather than the groups of lineages used by the Heteri and Chlendi.  As they were conquered and assimilated by the Chlendi a few of the practices intermixed.  The Chlendi term for clan, "qod", saw use, though most "clans" were simply lineages of higher status.  In the time of the Chlendi dominated these clans were almost exclusively owners of lands, rather than the lineages of peasants and sersf that worked the lands.  As the Eskla Empire bloomed and time progress, lower class lineages imitated the wealthy and began calling their family or lineage a clan, often creating fictional legends surrounding a founder.    Among wealthy Maetah families, clan markers are in a manner like those of the Clendi and Heteri; the marking of doors, gates and entrances.  In this case the form is of a single pillar or obelisk. The pillar is drapped with a banner engraved with runes decsribing the clans role or history.  Maetah "clan" sigils are simple drawings of lines, dots, and curves, enclosed by a circle.  The sigils of Maetah sorcerers, leaders, deities, and spirits use similar elements, but are enclosed in a downward pointing triangle.|

Rikuu had headed back to his hovel to check on the family, and Irosk & Nisik returned to the local tavern at which they had lodging.  The group would go their separate ways the next day and meet up at dusk.  We began on the 12th of Lilvun, 3042.  Nisik had exchanged a few courier messages with Simac, a fellow Chlendi sorcerer from his youth that was in town.  After checking other possible source of esoteric knowledge in town, he sought him out at a Sorcerers' Lodge run by Kabrah in the southern part of town.  After being personally greeted by Kabrah, he spoke with Simac, who was still wearing odd black makeup and clothing from a ritual.  Simac told him of conflicts he saw to the north in Nipend and his fear of returning there.  Argaevaligne was attempted to annex the city-state.  He wasn't comfortable in Cuvuaw either, and was worried that Nisik was under surveillance while in town. Nisik asked for his assistance in researching the names "Johud" and "Walker in the Wastes", and Simac agreed to send him word of any findings.  Meanwhile, Irosk went to meet with Glaiush of Shattered Hoof Clan, local leader of the Commerce Guild.  He keyed him into some ongoings with local politics that might be of interest to others.  Glaiush was intrigued by the contacts that Irosk had made in just one day, and pleased with the progress of trade and caravanning.  He felt it was in the Guild's best interest to be on good terms with the recently, title, wealthy, and ostensibly eligible Baroness Ilwaen. Most of the other nobles in town owed the wealth and status to Comte or the products of the local mines that for odd historical reasons were under control of the Jeweler's Guild.  The two force were in league, leaving the Commerce Guild out in the cold.  The two discussed a number of plots, including the "swaying" of caravans in hire of the Jewelers' Guild, and the status of the Comte's son, currently in route to Cuvauw.  That evening, the pair made two trips to the "hospital".  Stange events were at foot. While approaching the asylum, they were passed at the gate by two riders on horseback, a rare occurrence so late in the evening.  While visiting a suspicious character in the sub-sub-basement, Irosk noted a young boy in purple livery being dragged into a cell.  Upon later reflection, Nisik hypothesized this might be a page of the Sorcerer's Lodge he visited earlier.  The interrogated the suspicious character himself, a mousy man named Paedruun, claims to have killed a pair of "small trolls" out in the woods behind the farmlands, and saw one expunge another of the white worms.  After further "treatment" by Vanos, he admitted to still having the worm.  It was being kept in a "secret spot" out in the woods.    They also headed upstairs to ask Chivat (the Musthyuch priest who had coughed up the white worm) further questions, and check with Fulwen.  Opening the locked cell, they found both missing.  The only signs of their disappearance was a shredded piece of rope which once restrained Chivat, and a man-shaped outline of blood upon the wall.  It coursed with magical energy.  Under questioning, Vanos claimed he had seen nothing unusual since they were last checked.  Leaving the asylum, Irosk noticed a pair likely thugs tailing them, but lost them through some navigating in the crowds and sidestreets.  Returning to their rooms, Nisik found a message waiting from Simac.  According to his findings, 'Johud' was a named of Chlendi origin.  "The Walker in the Wastes" is a phrase from Mindat mysticism, which refers to the dark side of one's mind, which is the final phase in the process of self-purification.  Simac thought he could find out more, but was suddenly called back to his lodge in Nipend.  Nisik & Irosk hoped to catch up with Rikuu and Viktor shortly, and examine the "trolls" as well as farmhouse they had found directions to (in the Baron's hunting shack).  We ended with the characters awakening on Lilvun the 13th, 3042.|

205|205|2003-12-11 16:21:19|shawnbarrick|12/09/2003 Session Summary|12/09/2003 Tuesday Night Session Summary, or "New Bones & Holy Cows"  We began on the morning of Lilvun 13th, 3042, when Rikuu had caught up with the others at the Gateway Tavern.  Word had been sent to Viktor, but no response.  He had not been seen in two days.  The plan was to investigate the findings of this man (Paedruun) in the "hospital" and then check out the farmhouse they had previously found directions to.  Both were among the fields west of the city.  But first, Rikuu felt it would be valuable to consult a soothsayer about some of the strange findings.  The trio ventured off to the slums in search of Mokush, a Heteri Soothsayer that Rikuu's father suggested.    They found her in a makeshift shackle built from rubble in a slowly collapsing alleyway.  She was making some sort of stew that they could smell a block a way.  Only Rikuu entered. After an initial divination, she proclaimed "I need new bones!" and sent them off in search of a live bird.  The found a fine southern bird, a purple and grey sikoltok, at the market in the old amphitheater.  Returning with the bird, Mokush had it walk towards a crystal, and then gutted the fowl, reading answers from its intestines.  Rikuu kept the bird's head as a momento.  The soothsayer revealed that 'Johud' was the name of a spirit, and could be either friend or foe.  Tbe white worms individually are not a difficult to defeat, but they represent an ancient, greater foe.  Not sure what to make of this new knowledge, they headed to the asylum to grab Paedruun.  They ended up "purchasing" him from the asylum master Vanos, who dragged him out of the sub-sub-basement in reasonable condition.  The Baron's body was still tucked away in a cell, and Vanos was a little uneasy about it's continued presence.  He was also anxious to remove the blood drawing up Chivat's old cell, but kept it locked and (still) unoccupied in the interim.    Paedruun stopped at his book-filled hovel to grab his keys and then led the band through the fields to his shack and liquor-still in the woods at the edge of the foothills.  Waiting there were a few thugs, who had been purchasing Paedruun's grain-booze and selling for a tidy profit beneath the watch of the Brewer's Guild.  They were anxious for they're lasted shipment, which was behind due to Paedruun's incarceration.  A show of force scared them off, though the thugs attempted an ill-advised ambush when the group left the woods.  While Paedruun tended to his still, Irosk & Nisik examined the contents of the shack and the condition of the captured white worm, and Rikuu began to dig up the bodies of the "trolls" the worm came from.  Expecting hill people, beastmen, or some other humanoid, they were a little surprised to find two children from town lying in the shallow graves.  No evidence of a second worm was seen, and Paedruun maintained that he killed the "trolls" out of self-defense.  Not terribly surprised by the man's psychosis, they left him to his still and headed to the farmhouse.  Aside from the ambush, it an uneventful hour's walk through the fields to the farmhouse the directions specified.  Its yard was overgrown and the gate locked.  Noting the Maetah clanmarker at the wall, the climbed over the fence, and headed toward the house.  Before long, Nisik tripped over a dead cow lying in the high weeds.  There was at least a dozen spread out across the field in similar condition.  All without signs of trauma or disease, but dead, and bearing a brand shaped in the sigil of Musthyoch, the Maetah deity of animals, life, and blood, and patron of Chivat, the cultist who had escaped.  Oh yeah, and all the cows were missing their eyes.  Uneasy with continued trend of dead people and animals, mutilated or not, the three cautiously approached the farmhouse, which appeared recently abandoned and in ill repair.  A search of the building found little of note, though people not doing much farming had occupied it.  The only point of interest was the basement, revealed through a trapdoor in the pantry. They found evidence and tools of rituals; candles, knives, herbs, and incense.  The center of the room had a large magic circle drawn in blood with a chair in the center, not unlike what was found in the Baron's hunting lodge.  Nisik detected that the circle was still active with the aura of conjuration and abjuration.  Not wanting to meddle further with unknown sorceries, they band headed back for town, returning just after dark.|

I don't care if the characters split up, as long as no one is getting bored waiting for others to take care of things. Last night in particular, I wanted to keep things moving since Nathaniel had missed a couple sessions. Also, so far you've done an admirable job of avoiding violence.  It may not always be that easy.  - Clues, hints, investigation.  Don't worry about "did me miss that vital clue hiding under Joe Heteri's bed?".  I've got my setting and a general direction for the plot.  Beyond that I fill in details and ideas a couple session ahead of time.  There are "quasi red herrings" and other events to keep things moving, keep people from zoning out, and for the sake of the setting and future plots.  Beyond that your interaction with NPC's and choices tell me what gets fleshed out and what directions to go.  A nudge here or there to keep you going in that general direction as needed.  Once we get to the "next stage" of the plot, I go back and point out a few things that might be helpful for understanding my rambling and improvisation in the future.  S.|

After a few days absence, Viktor had reappeared.  He had been held under "house arrest" by the priests of Thedine, working with the tacit permission of the Comte.  They questioned him about the circumstances of the Baron's death and surrounding events.  They kept him fed and in good condition, and released him after some sort of internal dissent among the priests.  Some of the nogs questioned were not so lucky.  After a night's rest, he caught up with the rest of our troublemakers at their usual breakfast spot.  They relayed accounts of the past few days and exchanged conspiracy theories, mostly Rikuu's.  While the rest sought more information at the asylum, Viktor would head out to find Elle. He initially headed to the Comte's manorhouse, where Elle had be staying during the commotion of the funeral and search for her father's corpse.    Viktor exchanged a few pleasantries with the Comte and learned that during his absence she had returned home.  Despite his suspicions, the Baron seemed genuinely concerned about her welfare and the location of the Baron's body.  The Comte told Viktor he would lead a purge through the hills come spring, intent on wiping out the ever-growing Hill People menace that he blamed for the corpse-knapping.  After grabbing some food, Viktor headed the Ilwaen manorhouse.  It seemed largely empty, and the front entrance was barred.  He made his way through the back gate, find a few servants present, but no nogs.  He eventually discovered Elle in her bedroom sedated and growing ever-drowsier from the doctor's herbal tonic.  Vaguely on route to the Hospital was the townhouse of one the leaders of the Brewer's Guild.  Irosk felt it was his "civic duty" to report the distilling operation they found in the woods.  Only his assistants was available, but took down the vague location and thanked Irosk for his efforts.  The Brewer's Guild while incapable of outlawing liquor production, controlled it's sale in the city and would be grateful to the Commerce Guild for Irosk's initiative.  The trio were beginning to feel a little too comfortable at the asylum.  Rikuu went in the crawlspace behind Vanos' "office" to examine the Baron's corpse.  After nearly five days, the Baron's body had not decayed a bit.  Still no breathing or vital signs.  He caught with Irosk and Nisik trying to enter the cell that once held Chivat and Fulwen.  Vanos' had just clubbed one of his assistants to death after seeing him mess with the blood outline on the wall.  The outline appeared to be some sort of portal.  Gutting the assistant body's in case it held a worm, Rikuu ("the Butcher") splattered blood everywhere, including the wall.  They could see the walk grow hazy and indistinct, but fade back to solidity after a minutes.  Enough blood enabled them to activate the portal, with Nisik initially exploring.  A few minutes later Irosk and Rikuu followed.  It lead to a rough-hewn stone chamber somewhere below the ground.  After some experimental with the portal, Irosk, Nisik and Rikuu headed down the tunnel.  A rough-hewn rock passage led to a branch of the sewer system, like the escape path of Chivat and/or Fulwen.  While wet, smelly, ad filthy, they saw little of interest and no sign of the escaped duo.  With some basic orienteering and following the drain of the water, the trio found their way out to the river, where the sewers drain in the northeast portion of town.  Retreating to their rooms and homes, they cleaned up and met with Viktor at the tavern, again exchanging their finds.  After some more discussion and more of Rikuu's conspiracy theories, they decided to head out and try to question some of the priest of Musthyoch.  While heading through the Merchant's Ward to the Temple of Musthyoch, a young man in robes jumped from the crowd, reaching for Rikuu.  The man saw Rikuu as "the one with the wild eyes", sensing some sort of mystical quality about him, and mentioned the word 'Johud'.  Taking the boy aside for interrogation, he revealed his membership in the Cult of the Vaporous Host. The Cult sought out signs of the end of the world, when 'The Old Gods' would return.  A small contingent had crossed referenced the occurrence of "signs" with the holy book, and came to Cuvauw looking for the next set of signs.  While Rikuu was a bit concerned, Nisik couldn't decide if the guy was (another) loony, or if he was just pissed that he wasn't chosen as some sort of prophet.  From there, they headed through the alleys to the Court of the Northern Gods, where temple and shrines to the Maetah pantheon stood.|

Each follows similar form, lining the sides of the street, with the largest at the end.  Each shrine is built upon a 6' - 8' high cut stone "plaza", with a central 8'-10' wide staircase leading up from the street.  At the foot of each staircase is a statue depicting the god.  All the statues are cut from the same stone in similar style, unclothed, standing straight up and with few features.  The temple and shrines themselves are one to three stories, mostly of timbered mudbrick.  The roofs fan out in pagoda style with each story, and are covered in slate tiles of natural colours.  The shrines are laid out in the following order, starting on the left side of the lane, following the cul-de-sac to the right side: Thedine, Hilinavyu, Ubo, Eluus, Musthyoch, Lob, Storm Mother, Uzhidhomi.  Notes on individual shrines  Thedine: The small shrine of Thedine is locked, barred, and its statue draped in black.  Hilinavyu: The shrine is built of rough hewn rock, unlike the others, with two fire pits out front burning day and night.  The statue is blank, with two eyes, rimmed in black. Two stories tall.  Ubo: The shrine of Ubo had no door, but an entrance draped with furs of grey and white.  It is two stories tall and conical, unlike the others. The statue has its eyes shut.  Eluus: Largest of the shrines, it is three stories tall. The status is the standard of the avenue, simple and without decor.  Musthyoch: Also three stories the shrine of Musthyoch stands next to that of Eluss. Its statue is blank, with two eyes and four arms reaching out in different direction.  Lob: The shrine is two stories, with the lower floor built of cut stone of the same style as the plaza.  The statue of Lob is blank with two eyes, and tusks  Storm Mother: The temple is large, domed, with pool on the plaza in front. The statue is blank, with two eyes, though on arm is outstretched with a goblet inhand.  Uzhidhomi: The shrine of Uzhidhomi is open air with no doors.  Its statue is blank, with three eyes, all closed.|

Fearing for their safety, and puzzled by the message from the book, they headed up through the hills to Yellow Banner Peak.  Nearing the Baron's old hunting lodge, a pack of hill people dropped down from the trees in ambush.  Rikuu ducked back to fire some arrows, while Nisik chanted some incantations and summoned forth some lunar hounds.  Viktor fired off his pistol, shocked to see how resilient the furred, horned beasts were.  He took it down, but not before being badly gored by it's horns.  Irosk climbed up from the ground and began attacking the one that jumped him. He was even more badly hurt and blows from horns and blades, and was barely able to stand.  Viktor was able to take down that foe as well, while another of Nisik spells caused the two final beasts to fight among themselves and run off through the woods.  Nearing midnight and badly hurt, they bound their wounds and headed to the lodge.  Arriving the hunting lodge, they found the building had been searched, but nothing missing. Out front were the ravaged remains of a few horses. Later, Rikuu would find the corpses of their riders' out in the woods, also mangles and partially eaten.  The set up watch and rested for the evening.  Just before dawn, the remaining two hill people returned killing Rikuu's horse before they could be dispatched.  The Heteri said a prayer to Utan for the horse, and their retired for further rest. That night Nisik had a dream of Johud. They relaxed and healed up on the 15th, and head up into the hills the following morning, the chair strapped to Nisik's mule.  It was early afternoon when the reaching Yellow Banner Peak, a craggy outcropping and a small level area and some caves.  A pair of nogs had been buried there, with grave markings in the style of the Chlendi. Ever the grave robbers, the little corpses were disinterred and examined, apparently dying from starvation.  In one of the caves was evidence of some sort of ritual, with a number of rocks of amberite left behind.  The other cave showed signs of mining, and had tunnels reaching further back into the hill. Lighting torch and lantern, they march in, stopping to examine a trail of dried slime entering a side-cave. In the cave they found more evidence of ritual proceedings.  Drawing upon the walls and floor, spent candles, astrological calculations. More mention of the Walker in the Wastes, written in Mindat.  Before they could explore further, the source of the slime trail approaches from the tunnel.  It's a large slug-like creature, who mistakes Rikuu for his father (Rikuu's father, not the slug) and knew the Baron in the past.  He has no names, but refers to himself as an "ontomo", and has dwelled within the caverns for many years.  He had no knowledge of Johud or the rituals taking place in the caverns. The ontomo did see a few Mindat riding lizards, which corroborated some of the tracks seen outside caverns.|

291|291|2004-01-12 15:02:18|shawnbarrick|The Golden Empire|THE GOLDEN EMPIRE ----------------- The Golden Empire was the high point of Heteri civilization in western  Rhiat.  Many tribes and city-states forged alliances and intermarried as a response to the growing power of the newly arrived Chlendi in the  north, and the spread of Mindat culture to the south.  The Golden Empire encompassed the southern Minkush River Valley, (now) Balaconth, and Vennosat at its height.  Bogog, a Heteri chief of the Naggai tribe, ruled the burgeoning city-state of Akklai in (what is now) southern Balaconth.  He married the daughters of the chiefs ruling Ven-no-sat and Minkushtown, and allied with the Vuhwuls of Cuvauw, Vhaemuth, and border towns to the east, united them under his banner.  The alliance lasted for nearly 200 years, as he fought Sofegai and rival chiefs to the west, and stabilize relations with the Chlendi to the north.  He supported the Chlendi during the onset of the Black Pox, beginning a relationship that would prove the Empire downfall.  Needing allying against rival Heteri chiefs and the encroaching Mindat, the Golden Empire allied with Chlendi clans, who saw a strong southern neighbor in their conquest of the Maetah.  The Heteri of the Golden Kingdom were wise enough not to trust all the clans under the Black Lily Crown and sough console with the Maetah clans, and met up a peak in hills north of Cuvauw, between the lands of both peoples. Fearing collusion, the Chlendi spied upon their allies, when the time came forth, empyreal beings of shadow and mist rose forth from the caverns below, slaying all at the meeting.  All that remained was the yellow banner of the Golden Empire.|

In the beginning the universe was a unordered matter, waiting to be led and directed.  Like dewdrops forming on a leaf, the semi-conscious bits of matter coalesced into forms, one of which we now call Thedine.  The other semiconscious entities where content with the chaotic sea of matter, but Thedine invested himself in this sea, tilling and planting with his soul and consciousness, until the sweat and blood of his efforts formed Uod and other lands.  The other entities saw this creation and mimicked it, but brought forth shallow devices with the dedication and toil of Thedine.  Thedine saw them and pitied them, and as an example created mankind upon Uod, and gave them freewill, so that all beings could see how anyone possessed of conviction and dedication could make meaningful creations.  The other spirits toiled again, some giving greater effort, creating beasts and winds and trees, but none could survive with out the gifts provided with investiture of Thedine.  Other spirits continued to enjoy their slothful ways, and taught mankind sorceries and tricks by which to create and control the world around them without sweat or toil.    Why follow the direction of Thedine instead of the path of the slothful spirits?  That is The Question of Morals.|

298|298|2004-01-13 13:26:25|shawnbarrick|Minkarapht|Minkarapht  Old Chlendi name was Kamaniilayaat. Renamed Minkarapht after war - means "battlement against the Mindat".  Old Chlendi city built on an ient heteri fort. Became the southern capital in the late eskla empire.  The farthest incursion of the Mindat into the Empire. They laid seige upon the city for a year and a moon.  The Mindat brought in a circle of sorcerers to bring down the city walls. Despite the Chlendi magicks, plague and starvation had set in, yet the city had not fallen.  In the midst of the riots, the imperial family had retreated to the palace, using fell magicks to secure the building.  The Mindat ritual crushed the city walls, leveling the city and killing most of the inhabitants.  Yet, amidst the rubble, the palace stood in silence.  Old walls still remain in places, and tunnels, trenches, and battlements dot the countryside.  After the reconstruction and the end of the war, no one disturbed the palace. Those entering have never returned.  The city now holds five "quarters", the nobles' still quiet.  The city was raised above ground level on plazas in the construction style of old Chlendi towns, leaving the old ruins below.  Pairs of statues commemorating the old emperors straddle both the rivers' entrances to the city walls, standing even above the huge spires that can be spotrted from miles away.|

301|301|2004-01-15 13:10:24|shawnbarrick|When I say Uod is pretty normal...|--- In tekumel@yahoogroups.com, "barke002" <barke002@e...> wrote: Dear Jeff and Others,  If you were to play "real Tekumel" -- Tekumel as close to the original as possible -- the "horror" woukd likely be that of your players as they were systematically hunted down and slaughtered -- and that of the referee, as his hopes for a fun scenario quickly vanished.  There are a *great* many problems with playing the "original EPT" version of Tekumel. Just to take a few issues that I might toss you, if I were your referee and were "going by the book":  In the original EPT, foreigners come into Jakalla Harbour as complete innocents. They have no backgrounds, no jobs, very little money or items that they can turn into gold; they do not speak the language and have to spend months (real time as well as game time) learning enough Tsolyani so that they are not killed by the first noble Tsolyani who takes offense at their barbarous pronunciation, brutish ways, and ridiculous costumes. They must stay inside the walls of the Foreigners' Quarter -- to go out is certain death at the hands of the city guards until they learn enough of the language and society to meet a patron and hold a menial job. There are no restaurants where foreigners can buy food. (The clans take care of this and do not sell to foreigners, unless they have the patronage of one of the other recognised nations of Tekumel, or are in the company of Tsolyani.) There are no bars or taverns: to mingle with persons of other status levels -- too high for you and too low for them -- is ignoble and a sure challenge to a duel, or straight on to imprisonment snd death. There are no hotels except some very, very low hostels that no self-respecting Tsolyani would ever visit. Foreigners cannot walk about a Tsolyani city and look for a job or an apartment! Foreigners cannot enter or leave a city without papers. Foreigners cannot even approach a high-class Tsolyani without fear of insulting him by their presence and uncouth language or accent -- which will certainly lead to imprisonment, slavery, and/or death. Foreigners cannot enter a Tsolyani temple without polluting it and thus getting arrested and executed. A foreigner or two can perhaps be magically transferred to Tekumel and dropped off in a wilderness or jungle far from a city. Hunting would then be their sole means of finding food -- no villager would dare to feed a foreigner! A large party of foreigners, such as you envisage, would draw attention -- and the constabulary, who would then be obliged to slaughter the lot of them since they cannot speak Tsolyani and have no identity documents. Nor can the party hide for long; it is too big and too unfamiliar with Tekumelani culture as well as the vegetation, dangerous animals, etc.  Carrying large amounts of iron or steel would entice any Tekumelani thief, and the temples, the government, etc. would probably simply confiscate the foreigners' supply, kill them to keep them quiet, and be done with it!  The pretty girl you mentioned would instantly be snapped up and sold as a slave. If she had an entourage of friends and defenders, they would be slaughtered, and she would then either be enslaved or killed. A lone beauty is just money in the bank to the slavers' clans. At best, if she did find a patron, he would not want to protect her because he could earn more by selling her -- if he tried to keep her for himself, he would risk other people trying to take her away for themselves. Being sold to a devotee of Lady Hrihayal or Dlamelish would be extremely unpleasant for an "independent" (= "modern"-- read "feminist" American or European girl! A foreign woman cannot gain "Aridani" (legally independent) status unless she is a ciizen, able to speak Tsolyani, and fluent in the culture.  Terran magic does not work on Tekumel -- our sorcery is based on principles that do not function there. Tekumelani magic works by drawing power out of the Planes Beyond, then moulding and shaping it with spells that no foreigner could know without years of study (to which he/she can never gain access!) Your "sun" and "moon" magic cannot function; they are based upon the Terran sun abd moon, which are many, many light years distant -- too far away for their powers to travel. Tekumel's sun and its two moons are simply astronomical bodies and have no magical powers of their own.  The Tsolyani language is a major obstacle. It is not very difficult, but it is necessary to learn not only grammar and phonetics but also such cultural items as the many forms of "you," etc. A foreigner needs much exposure to the culture to be sure of not offending a high-clan Tsolyani. The little golden "universal translator globes" proposed by Bob Alberti are too rare and costly to be a solution -- where is your large party going to come upon such a huge hoard of these devices? Even if you do, they only translate human spoken languages and do not impart reading or writing.  Tsolyanu is just as difficult as mediaeval Hindu India or pre-European Japan. The only way a foreigner can survive in Tsolyani society is to enter Tsolyanu at a recognised entry-port, take a menial job, and work his/her way up. ...Slowly. Other nations -- Mu'ugalavya, Yan Kor, Salarvya, etc. have their own peculiar problems, too! Put your party down in a distant jungle, and there are dangerous animals, poisonous vegetation, nutritional differences between the local foods and Terran fare -- etc. Survival on a rock sticking up out of the southern ocean might work -- but such a life would be lonely, like Robinson Crusoe. Even so, if a shipload of Hokun from Benre Sa or a Hluss vessel chanced upon the place, then there would be mayhem and an end to the adventure, one way or the other.  You may ask: how do new players get onto Tekumel at all? Either as barbarians (see above) or as *native Tsolyani.* The last player in our group who got in *the hard way" is the esteemed Arumel hiChankolel, who finally worked his way up to adoption by a good clan, a fine marriage, and acceptance even in the halls of Avanthar.  All of the rest of our new players (for the past twenty-five years or thereabouts) have started out as *native* Tsolyani. They have been of various social levels, but they always have had enough knowledge of the culture to survive without outside aid. Every new player is given a persona, including a clan, a religions sect, a knowledge of the language (often more than one), fluency in the society, etc. etc. We do this either by rolling dice against a series of tables, or the referee (me) picks a persona that fits the scenario (e.g. a sailor aboard a ship that is transporting the party). Much of what I have said above then no longer applies, and the party can enjoy the game.  I urge you to set up a Tsolyani party, cancel (temporarily, until their jaunt on Tekumel is finished) all of the non-Tekumelani magic, appearances, gadgets, etc. that would make your people stand out as aliens. Instead of trying to disguise themselves and avoid the problems described above, help them to fit in and cooperate in the world which they are visiting.  It's either this or else modify Tekumel beyond recognition. Do as you see fit.   > The ritual the characters use is based on a pentagram enclosing the  rift > they wish to close.

AKKLAI POINT  Great Heteri city built upon the cliff edge overlooking the sea and a hidden bay, founded by Coweulz of the Naggai Tribe.  Noted for the outlying fortresses running along the coast, the machinery connecting the cliffs to the ports below, and most of the great spire of stone jutting up and outward from the cliff face.  In old days, offerings to the sea gods were thrown from this spire to the waves and rocks below.  Paupers and heartbroken lovers still end there lives from this spot regularly.  Akklai Point is the capital of Balancont, even despite it's goblin rule.  The subordinate cland of the region, the Broken Waterserpents brokered deals with the goblins below and aided their conquest of the fortresses and clanhouses.  They believed that the deal would break the stranglehold of Heteri clans that had sold out to the Eskla Aristocracy and allow a revitalization of ancient Heteri glories.  They were wrong.

Viktor's family finds the keeping of servants to be beneath them and unworthy. Physical labor keeps the mind and soul clear, and the body strong. Therefore there are no servants to deal with.

As with most sons and daughters Viktor does not entirely agree with his mother's choice on this matter, and as you guess based on his actions Viktor has a different philosophy regarding menial labor.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

324|324|2004-01-23 09:56:23|shawnbarrick|Linquistic Comment|I was showing off some of the wacky Tekumel linguistic stuff on Tuesday.  There were a few comments related to apostrophes, etc, in languages.  Here's one explanation, not specific to Tekumel:  "Mandarin Chinese syllables have four tones, or intonation contours: high level; rising; low falling, and high falling. [For zhongguórén: No, I haven't described the third tone wrong. Think about it.] These tones are parts of the word, and can be used to distinguish words of different meanings: ma 'mother', má 'hemp', mâ'horse', mà 'curse'. Cantonese and Vietnamese have six tones. [The first tone should have a straight line over the vowel, and the circumflex over the third tone should be inverted, but this is the best I can do in html, and it beats adding numbers.]"|

They eventually all enter the circle.  - They "awake" in a clearing in the grasslands, underneath a purple sky.  To the "west" is hills, to the "east" a forest, though they're not sure of the time, place, and actual directions.  - They are stealthily approached by Ikar and a pair of fellow "Zhammi", 10' tall, eight-limbed beasts, who walk on four legs, with horns, sporadic clothing, and smooth blue-gray skin.  The Zhammi slice at the group, removing a think yellow membrane (the "caul")from them, after which everything seems to look much clearer.  - The Zhammi are friendly, offering drink and telling them of their surroundings, but can answer little about where they really are, and know nothing of Uod or the Rhiat.  They do know of Johud and the "Walker  in the Wastes", whom rule areas to the "north" and the "south".  They offer to lead them to the city in the south, "Zoit".  - Zoit has huge walls and towers, and is built of adobe and mudbrick.  The Zhammi lead them through the market, which is filled with people of various colours and shapes, and some of which seem vaguely human.  After a few beverages, it becomes apparent that the group is to be sold as slaves.  Before the transaction could be completed, or violence breaks out, the group is "bought" by a hooded figure, comprised of whispy black vapours, who then leads them away to a cafe.  - This figure turns out to be the Baron, and much is revealed.  He is not dead, but hiding in this "dream realm".  His meat body is not well, and is preparing to exist permanently in this realm, which he has been visiting for many years.  His current situation is inadvertant, and will soon return to Uod when the astrological timing is proper.  But he fears for the group, who has not entered properly and must leave soon or face danger.  He suggests they hide (bury) his "corpse" and bids them away.  Other notes: - The Baron knows little of the White Worms. - Johud rules The City Across the River, and is *not* a friend, and seeks power within Uod. - He doesn't like or trust the followers of Thedine, Musthyoch or the Comte, but none are directly involved to his knowledge.  Comments?  This is from memory.  I need to stop reading about glottal stops and pull out my notes.  S.|

Not the same as the OA one I referred to, but very close:  Commune With Lesser Spirit (Divination) Sphere: Necromantic Range: 10 feet Components: V, S, M Duration: Special Casting Time: 1 turn Area of Effect: Special Saving Throw: None  By use of the commune with lesser spirit spell, the priest is able to  contact any of the hundreds of local spirits which dwell in the land. Local  spirits are those with limited powers and range, the spirits of a particular  tree, rock, or stream are typical lesser nature spirits.  A spirit that haunts a  single building or compound could also be contacted.  To contact the spirit,  the priest must know its identity and must be within 10 feet of the area  where the spirit is found.  Once the spirit is contacted, the priest can ask it one question for  every level of experience he has gained.  The questions must be specific and  clearly worded, but are not limited to yes or no answers.  The spirit answers  questions literally and does not volunteer any information.  The answers are  always correct if the answer is known.  The types of answers given will  depend on the nature of the spirit that is being questioned.  The spirit can only answer those questions concerning the  immediate area it affects.  Questions beyond the scope of the spirit are  wasted.  The use of this spell is limited to once per week for any given spirit  in a particular area.  If a second casting of this spell is performed by the  same priest before a week is out, the spell fails.  However, a different priest  could contact the same spirit during the one week period.  The material components of this spell are incense and an offering  appropriate to the nature of the spirit.|

398|398|2004-02-23 22:07:54|shawnbarrick|[Heteri] Utan the Destroyer|Here's a bit of collected notes. I've been trying to cobble thing together during this "break". So far little luck with linguistics. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Utan the Destroyer, Patriarch of the Heteri Pantheon, and God of Warfare, Power, and Death. ---------------------------------  "A Feast to my enemies!"  Utan is a God to the Gods.  He destoyed the Old Gods, freeing the Heteri people, giving birth to the rest of the pantheon. All the other gods are considered his slaves.  Legend has it that Utan was the first chief of the Heteri people and slew the elder gods, gaining immortality by feasting on their blood and flesh.  He raised up his brothers and sisters, chiefs of the Heteri tribes to rule along side him as gods.He learned the secrets of warfare, herding and animal husbandry and taught them to the Heteri people.  In honour of this event, the day of spring, Heteri communities hold a great feast in Utans honour, sacrificing a capture enemy warrior in a funeral pyre.  But first, his blood is drained and mixed in casks of ale and wine for all to drink.  There are no true temples or priests of Utan.  The Heteri people recognize his as the greatest of gods, but realize he cares little for them.  All priests of the Heteri pantheon honour him foremost, through the patronage of the pantheon.  In the entranceway of every Heteri temple is a statue to Utan, and another towers over the later in the sanctum sactorum.  Utan cares not for your prayers.  He is busy keeping the heavens upheld from the earth.  Honour your clans and your Vuhwul, and you honour Utan.  You say no prayers to Utan, but still call out his names.  You pray "to Kos, for Utan's Blessing", when you are lost and the steppes and starving for food.  You pray "to Jotesh, in Utan's name", when you acquire a new horse.  Utan reads the signs of the storms as laid out by Lihoe, and from here sees the fortunes of man.  Upon death each man goes before Utan, to acribe value to his life.  Lihoe pleads your case to Utan, and if you have lived an honourable life, you will dwell forever in Utan's grassy plains, sleeping under the stars and the warm sun, riding and hunting beast for food and sport.|

They are perfumed for style, and also scented to keep away insects in the swamps.  Tapered Hide - Heteri - Traditional head covering is an embroidered leather hood, which wraps around the neck or chest as a sash or scarf. Strings of beads, feathers, braided hair & fabric used as decor.  Hats are generally forbidden in Argaevaligne.  The nobility may choose to wear styles they prefer, and the Church of Thedine has its own ritula garb.  Hoods, often lines with furs, are the typical hearwear among the lowerclasses. Helms are only allowed when blade is worn on belt.  There are ornate style of hair braiding, and beads and other jewelry are often woven in.  Modern fashions have evolved from the Mindat "bowler style".  In the south, many Heteri have taken to wearing a wide, flatbrimmed version to shield from the sun.  Along the coast, this same style is worn, in fancier materials, with the brim pinned up in the front or sides.  The height of fashion is now in Ven-no-sat, and the Minkush River Valley cities, where nobles and fops try to outdo each other with ornate, uncomfortable hats of expensive materials, lace trim, and rare feathers and embelishments.|

411|411|2004-02-25 16:54:41|shawnbarrick|If you're a Minday [Part I]|If you're from the Mindat -------------------------  Home & Family ------------- - The earliest thing you remember is your sept, a group of 4-12 others, both male and female, of the same age.  You were probably birthed in the home of your biological mother or the building of a midwife or physician.  You do not know who you biological father is.   - You live in a small hut or house (materials depend on the local climate), with a kitchen, common room, communal sleeping chamber, and another room for your mentors (if your sept has enough wealth). You all sleep in hammocks or cots in a single room. - You are monitored by a pair of mentors, are replaced ever year or two.  The teach you, keep you fed, and show you how to interact with others in the community. - Your sept probably has a nog or two to help with cooking and cleaning.  If your sept is wealthy or of high class, you may have a Heteri slave, or even a Bantanog for tending the field, protection or other menial labor. - You may take on many sexual partners during your life, though many people have sequential exclusively relationships.  It is common for partners to be be found among members of your sept.  Any children you father will be raised in a sept with other children of a similar caste born that year.  Language -------- - You certainly know Mindat, and you are likely fluent in Heteri if you were raised in the north, or come from a well off sept. - You probably speak a bit of Ven-no-sat or even North Common, unless you're from a labor caste sept.  Employment ---------- - You have little choice.  You can always desert your sept and leave Mindat lands, but your return will means a lifetime of field labor at best. - The caste of your sept largely determines what sort of "career" you'll be apprenticed into.  You teachers believe proper work and meditation can provide almost anyone with the necessary skills for a task.  Provided you've been born into the right caste. - If you exhibit special talents, particularly of a mystical bent, you may be removed from yoru sept before puberty.  This is quite an honour, but your normally be taken to a new sept far away, and your will always miss your former septmates.  Religion -------- - No one really discusses religion.  You hear stories of the "Old Gods" as a child, and they seem like crazy stories.   - Various schools of natural philosophy have different explanations for the movement of the stars, the winds, and "supernatural" phenomena that other cultures attribute to gods, spirits, and the like.  If you are of an academic bent, you probably lean towards one or more theories.|

There seem to be two schools of thought about how to do this in d20. The system used in Star Wars and I think Spycraft is extra dice. You spend an action point and add 1d6 to whatever roll you spent it on. The dice go up with level. I find this pretty boring.  Unisystem and I think some other d20 games like Ebberon allow you to do a lot more with Drama points including reduce damage, find clues, and do heroic stuff. I would prefer this kind of system but it will take more work to design.   > - Generic classes   Works for me.   > - Some version of Honor   Not sure what this adds. Uod is such a morally grey setting that honor doesn't seem to be a big deal. Of course the same could be said for Conan and it has an honor system. I'd need to see how Conan tracks it to have a better idea of how this would work mechanically and what it would add to the game.

That't the concept in a nutshell.  It would reduce a big chunk of the combat feats.  Of course, it's mostly combat feats & magic feats to begin with.  If anyone sees cool class abilities they'd like to convert to feats, LMK.|

Uod is such a morally grey > setting that honor doesn't seem to be a big deal.    One of the reasons we started in the region of Cuvauw is that it's not as honour-focused.  I figured lots of names, places, cultures, and gods were enough to deal with.  And because I'm still roughing out codes of conduct ;)  I think in the next plot arc you'll see a little more of it.  The fact that both Irosk and Nisik have been far from their clans made it a little easier to ignore.  A development that *may* occur for Viktor will make it a little more obvious.  In the case of our previous sessions, the priests of Thedine weren't necessarily "good" in the alignment sense, but they were "honourable". Think more of a culturally specific code of proper and improper behavior and less of "absolute right and wrong".  What makes it messy is the culture clash.   > Of > course the same could be said for Conan and it has an > honor system.

For the warriors it's any six skills + craft.  With the Background "race", you'll get either a couple free ranks, or a couple skills that also count as "class skills".   > > > > - Some version of taint/corruption/sanity  > We should move this to a new thread.

Makes sense.  Though I'd just count as shield as a weapons with a real good "parry modifier", and the only way you could (with "kung-fu"), parry missile weapons.  Conan uses a class/level based parry and dodge bonus in place of a generic "class defensive modifier".    > > Right now in d20, two weapons is a no brainer.

I'll self edit to Code fo Conduct and I should be fine.  I'm not a fan of alignment systems, but I do like systems where you outline what's important to your character. Allegiances, bonds, whatever you want to call them.  For example, Viktor would have these Allegiences:  Self (high) Having fun (moderate) Elle/Baron's estate (Moderate) Family (moderate) Knights of Plausible Deniability (low)  He'd also have some negative scores towards the Priesthood of Thedine and the Compte.  I'll give soem thought to his personal Code of Conduct as well.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

Playing a "traditional" Super Heroes game with characters made using Call of Cthulu rules would work. I don't think I've found the right one. Right now based on everyone's comfort level, and my time to tweak a rules system which writing setting material and running game, make something d20 the "right-now" answer.  We've averaged less than one combat a session, so characters built with a combat focus find much of their abilities worthless.  Going by 3.x rules, that's a big chunk of the character sheet.|

Part of the problem is that aside from those priests, everyone Maetah (Viktor and the Baron's clan) have been isolated, and apart from tradition Maetah society.  It's made things easy to ignore, but also left you hanging a little.|

Between Point Blank shot and the free ranger combat style feats, Rikuu can be pretty lethal with a bow, even at low levels.  This is a side effect of the 3.5 ranger class, and not really what I envisioned when I came up with the character concept.  Luckily most of my combat feats are freebies from the class, as we don't see combat enough to justify buying them as general feats.  	In this regard I really like the generic classes.  	Collin|

I'll self edit to Code fo Conduct and I should be fine."  	I can see Rikuu playing up a larger sense of honor, though far from the ideals of chivalry.  I'm thinking more along the lines of the hobgoblins in the Kalamar setting, or maybe the Klingons.  Another way of looking at it might be a more Middle Eastern/Indian notion of honor, or perhaps popular notions of the Mafia.  Personal honor as a reflection of clan and family honor.  	Sort of rambling here: Rikuu wouldn't steal from a clan member, or outright lie to someone he has sword allegiance to; in the position of a clan chief or whatnot.  That would be the Baron, others of the Fouled Water Clan etc. Even when it comes to his father, Rikuu has lied by omission rather than making stuff up. The Knights are a gray zone, but as a band bound by common purpose and bonded through combat, they count as "clan" for purposes of honorable behavior; Irosk more so that Nisik and Viktor, as he is heteri. Others are fair game and not deserving of that level of codified behavior, though heteri would be given some level of respect. 	Avenging personal slights in not a matter of honor to him, in the sense of no insult going unpunished.  Major indignities are worthy of retribution. Ikar tops the list, as he sold us into slavery.  Taking revenge on Chivat or the priests of Thedine has no honor component to it, however.  	In combat poison would be out of character for him, as it isn't cricket to his way of thinking, but he would not hesitate to attack infantrymen from horseback, set an ambush, attack an unarmed opponent with a weapon, or gouge eyes and give a swift kick to the nuts in a brawl.  Winning a combat is not an expression of virtue so much as a matter of survival.  "For example, Viktor would have these Allegiences: Self (high) Having fun (moderate) Elle/Baron's estate (Moderate) Family (moderate) Knights of Plausible Deniability (low)"  	I'd say Rikuu would have: The Fouled Water Clan (high) The Baron (high) Self (moderate) Knights of Plausible Deniability (moderate) The Heteri race (low) Vanos (low)  	Collin|

441|427|2004-03-04 21:07:31|Mark Simpson|Re: Honour (Was Rule Tweaks, etc)|Evening, Thursday  4, March 2004  Most important to Nisik is his Word; his bonds and oaths.  These Pacts and Cthonic Bonds are what give him his powers.  He likes having plausible deniability since he doesn't want to be put into a position where he would have to lie too much.  Such facts could get out amongst the creatures he deals with and if they won't accept his word, then he is pretty screwed (or at least the prices would go up).  As far as allegiances he thinks of himself, his oaths (but not necessarily allegiance to those creatures... unless that is part of the oath), his clan, the Chlendi, the Knights (as long as they are useful).  As far as such things as poison, ambushes etc. etc.  they would have to be dealt with incident by incident: what would it gain Nisik vs. what would he gain and would it cause any problems with his oaths.|

442|427|2004-03-05 10:07:41|widderslainte|Re: Honour (Was Rule Tweaks, etc)|Took another glance at Conan last night.  It doesn't have specific mechanics for Honour.  It has two codes of honour listed.  If you stick by your code of honour, you get a bonus to Will saves and your reputation.  The reputation score chart is a hoot, btw.  Each of the Codes has a list of things (and circumstances) you likely would and wouldn't do.  For example showing mercy to fallen foes, giving hospitality to strangers, and lying.  The file I mentioned last night is a different system, where you list priorities (such as self, family, gods, nation, etc) in a chart from top to bottom, sometimes excluding some.  For each that you put on the list, you have an obligation to.  It's based on D&D alignments, but the handling of Chaotic elements is a little hokey.  S.|

Hrm.  This is pretty much stream of thought too, so it may be disjointed.  Irosk has been formed by a code of conduct as well, but this wouldn't be considered what I'd call "high honor" in any sort of way.  He is half Hetari, and was raised Hetari, so that clan system forms a large basis of his relationship with others.  Much like Rikku, norms of respect and bonds of kinship within and without the clan exist.  Add to that his merchant background, where he's found a good way to earn repeat business (and future profits!) is to deal with customers honestly.    That doesn't necessairly mean always above the board in manners of intra-guild fighting, or other disturbance (recall that Irosk was in favour of waylaying the Compte's son on his journey back to Chevat).  But it does mean that if he commits to something, he's going to try to keep his word.  It's good for business, after all.   > "For example, Viktor would have these Allegiences: > Self (high) > Having fun (moderate) > Elle/Baron's estate (Moderate) > Family (moderate) > Knights of Plausible Deniability (low)" >  > I'd say Rikuu would have: > The Fouled Water Clan (high) > The Baron (high) > Self (moderate) > Knights of Plausible Deniability (moderate) > The Heteri race (low) > Vanos (low)    I would rank Irosk's Allegiences as:  The Red Bridle Clan (high) The Merchant's Guild (high) Gailush (moderate-high) Self (moderate) KoPD (moderate, but the most fluid of these) The Hetari (low) The Mindat (very low)   Dave|

As you build up corruption, you start having nightmares, hearing voices,  become addicted to lotus beverages (in Hyboria), lose interest in codes  of honour, get bonuses to rolls for doing mean or nasty things, get  charisma bonuses when dealing with nasty people or demons, and starting  getting physical deformties at extreme levels.  How do get corruption?  By failing certain types of will saves  ("corruption saves"): botching sorcery attempts, certain rituals and  items provoke, as does various entities, spell effects, and consorting  with daemons.  *whew*  I believe UA has something similar in taint.   > "* Destiny: reveal secret element of character past > * Destiny: minor change in plot" >  > 	Ah, the clue-by-four.

Something like that.  Using the same "points" for mechanics as well as drama is appealing to me.|

[grin]   Once you've gotten "disabled", another hit will put you at dying, where  you make Fortitude saves every round or die.  So it's easy to get  knocked out, but a little harder to die unless you're alone.   > Given these two options Damage reduction sounds like a better option > if you want to change the existing AC options.

Conan gives a much more significant armor reduction, though I think you  get hit more often, and weapons have an armour piercing quality. The  dodge/parry system in Conan is intriguing as well.|

So if you show back up immediately it takes lots of points, if you wait a session it takes fewer.  I'd also like to see something like "Just a Flesh Wound" which allows you to spend a point to reduce damage from an attack.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

I'll have to  > look up Conan's system as contrast.   I'm liking the combat system in the Game of Thrones d20 game I'm playtesting.  Attacker rolls to hit against Defender's AC. AC is Dex + Class bonus, so its low (generally 4-6ish) so most attacks hit. Defender then can choose to Dodge or Block. If they Dodge and get hit armor provides DR of 1-6. If they Block and succeed then they add their shield DR and their armor DR (total is ususally 2-11). So a warrior in full metal armor with a good shield is a tough, tough opponent. Hence the combat system adds in called shot rules which allow you to take penalties to hit in order to reduce or negate the armor.   >  > - Injury levels.  I have a pdf of this.

Here's how Game of Thrones handles this. Each character has a Shock value of 1/2 Con. Anytime they take damage equal to or greater then their Shock Value they have to make a Fort save DC 15 or passout for as many rounds as they fail the save. Also they take a Critical Injury which gives them a -1 to actions and they bleed 1 pt/minute until they get some first aid.  I've only played with it in a couple of combats, and it adds some bookkeeping for the DM, but I think it models injury and damage much more "realistically". So it'll be a crappy system when I run MegaDungeon 5000.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! Search - Find what you�re looking for faster http://search.yahoo.com|

I'd say the kitchen sink would be a two handed medium sized exotic weapon.  Say 1d8 19-20/x3 damage?  Can be used to parry, can be taken with Weapon Expertise.  For Large creatures it could be used as a helmet.  No effect to AC but a -2 for all diplomacy/perform skill checks where you want people to take you seriously and +2 if you don't.  +5 for hide since normal people will simply not want to acknowledge a large creature with a kitchen sink on their head.  There... now this d20 game _even_ includes the kitchen sink.|

As I've stated to Nate before, in my perfect *d20* world, I'd take three or four core classes, and build everything else from templates, feats, and skills.  The spellcaster still needs some tweaks, and I'd like to take more class abilities (from other classes in other books) and convert them to feats as well.  That setup may not work for Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, or "Captain X's Wolf-hunting, Dungeoncrawling, Hobbit-knockoff Campaign Extravaganza", but for my cult-happy, worm-spewing, eye-missing stories, it sounds pretty good.|

That's 6-9 points of damage for almost anyone.  An arrow or a good sword blow takes most people down. Realistic, sure.

Noble Favored Skills: Diplomacy, Knowledge (Nobility) These skills are considered class skills, +1 competence bonus if they are already class skills.  Feats Noble Presence: Nobles have the ability to back up nearly any threat or promise they make. As a result, their words are both feared and respected. Nobles gain a +1 bonus every 5 levels (1, 5, 10, 15, 20) to all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made when dealing with all non-noble characters, and halve the bonus (round down to a minimum of 1) when dealing with characters of lesser noble status. For example, a 6th Level Noble would have a +2 bonus when dealing with his smallfolk, and a +1 bonus when dealing with someone of a lesser House.  Resource Access: Starting at 3rd level, the noble character is able to bring the resources of his or her House to bear. Once per session (or more often as appropriate), the noble can make a Charisma check to use those resources. These resources should rarely come in the form of actual monetary wealth, but most often are represented as goods or services.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

These are from the Hunter base class in Game of Thrones, which is a class I really like.  Native Terrain: When a hunter is in a chosen region, he or she gains a +2 dodge bonus to Defence. If the Dexterity bonus to Defence is lost for any reason, he or she also loses this bonus. Furthermore, the character gains a +2 bonus to any Knowledge: Nature, Search, Spot, and Survival checks made within a chosen region.  Additionally, when hunting an animal native to the chosen region, the hunter acts as if he or she had the Improved Critical Feat. These bonuses only apply out of doors.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! Search - Find what you�re looking for faster http://search.yahoo.com|

Rikuu: Heteri  	I'd say Ride would always be a class skill, and perhaps Animal Handling as well to represent the heteri cultural affinity for horses.  As an alternative, Animal Affinity as a bonus feat, as it gives +2 on Handle Animal and Ride checks.  Having Mounted Combat as a bonus feat as well may fit, though the Animal Affinity would apply to everyone in the culture, more so than the warrior caste who would be fighting as calvery.  	I guess I perceive the heteri as a bit of a combination of the Mongols and the Native American tribes of the Great Plains, that is after the Mongols started building permanent buildings in Northern China and got all civilized.

My idea was to basically run everyone at the same XP level, and just advance everyone at "chapter" points occassionally.  Give out the equivalent of "bonus xp" in the form of drama points, as well as accomodating varying attendance.  Unless I find a drama point to xp conversion, Nisik will need hard numbers of craft scrolls and the like.|

Any thoughts?"  	Perhaps a conversion ratio of 1 point per N XP, with the stipulation that the bonus xp can only be used for item creation or spells with an XP component, and not for class leveling.  This still leaves regularly accrued XP available for any item creation needs as well.  	Collin|

One idea is to make getting the components for an item more difficult so that h has to spend a lot of time or money getting them. I doubt anyone would mind if you hand waved the issue either.  __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! Mail - More reliable, more storage, less spam http://mail.yahoo.com|

The caravan enters Bolog, a bit after dusk.  Our fellows realize that Cuvauw is a bit of a queer duck, culturally speaking.  They meet The Good Doctor, and wonder whether is treatment is good or ill for the patient.  Goblins are seen on walls, nogs on ceilings, and people wander the streets with coal eyes.  Rikku suspects foul play, Nisik acts suspiciously, and Viktor ponders further church burnings.    +1 drama point to whomever posts their character's physical appearance/description by 5:00 PM Tuesday, or arrives with typewritten copy in hand.  Any administrative issues to resolve before the session (aside from my lack of write-up)?|

No, not Thedine :)  I've been thinking about character motivation for Rikuu, and I think he's going to have a bit of an identity shift being away from a more culturally integrated city like Cuvauw.  I can't see him wandering around in furs and beads proclaiming "Heteri is beautiful, man" but I think he's going to get more in touch with his cultural roots, and getting religion will be a big factor.

But frontier, pretty much.  There are two sorcerer lodges in town.  "Independents" aren't usually well know to the general public.  Nisik will stick out a bit.|

Sorcerer is a generic term for a practitioner of magic or dweomercraft.  We're at a good point for side-plots.  If there are other things the characters wish to pursue other than the Sorceress, Tuesday would be a good time.|

I was thinking in D&D terms about this sorceress.  If she has a 'spell book' that is very valuable and Nisik would want access to it so he could add to his repetoire of spells.  If the D&D concept of 'spell book' doesn't fit in Uod then i'll stop talking about them.  If they do exist then Nisik will want to find out if she has one so that he can get the knowledge of more spells in this way.|

Well, 1 question/level sounds reasonable right now, but when you get up a few more levels, that's an awful lot for a 2nd level spell.  When I have a moment, I'll pull out the SRD and compare with Speak With Dead.|

564|564|2004-03-22 12:26:06|Mark Simpson|XP & Item Creation|On the topic of XP and item creation i would be ok if we just wing it.  Currently the XP costs are very small and the gold & time costs really outweigh it.  Also if the goal is to keep all characters at the same level then the downside of XP cost (falling behind) isn't important.  There are other things which cost some XP in D&D: some spells, losing a familiar, acquiring negative-levels, and being raised from the dead.  The losing a familiar cost is not large, the spells run from low XP cost to large XP cost and the negative-levels and raising from the dead are pretty large losses.  An alternative to winging it would be to assign an XP amount to the drama points.  So perhaps 1 DP = 100X xp (where X is based upon the character level) then a character could cash in a DP for XP costs.  It would add back record-keeping unfortunately.|

I was thinking of something like that.  Based on other factors we discussed before, Nisik will have a cushion of XP for item creation/spells, the exact amount TBD.|

Once you approach the gates of Bolog, you realize you are still high up in the hills.  Ahead, bonfires gleam on the hilltops in and surrounding the town.  As you approach, the firepits become more evident, on top of hills and ridges both in and outside the city walls, and upon the walls, towers, and high structures that make up Bolog.  The largest of the bonfires are a pair marking the fortress-monastery of Hilivanyu, which towers over the north end of the city, set into the city wall and hillside itself.  View of the Gate  Whereas Cuvauw's wall showed evidence of grandeur and fine construction beneath their years of poor maintenance, Bolog's defenses almost blend into the countryside in the limited light.  Thick fieldstone walls buttress rock outcroppings, large boulders, and hunks of slag from the smelting furnaces.  In places molten iron appears to have been pour over weak points in the structure, and continually added to.  Anyone with a clue to engineering would have to be crazed to attempt to tunneling through.  Wood and stone parapets dot the wall top, manned with archers and siege weaponry.  The intended target of the defense seems obvious; the wall is top with stakes bearing the skulls and rotting heads of goblins.  Chunks of weaponry, bone, wood and metal debris line the road, and the presence of scavenger birds and vermin can attest to its age.  A few of the older corpses smoldering on the rotting corpse of a great lizard beast by the path to the gate.  The main 'gatehouse' is built into walls themselves, barely distinguishable aside from the gate itself.  Portcullises are on either end, with heavy wooden doors on the town interior side.  Past dusk, the portcullis is closed, and visitors must seek entry from the guard.|

572|572|2004-03-25 12:33:14|shawnbarrick|Heteri Prayercloths|Heteri Prayercloths  The term "prayercloths" actually refers to two distinct styles of the same item.  The traditional prayercloth is tied as a sash at the waist, hung across the shoulders for more formal occasions, and sometimes tied from a saddle or spear when on horseback.  It will contain the symbol of Utan and other gods, and sometimes the glyph of the person's clan.  More decorative versions will have an actually prayer stitched into the cloth.    The other style is genealogical.  Most Heteri are illiterate, but recognize a few letters and glyphs.  Virtually all know the symbols of local clans.  'Clan cloths' are used in the teaching of one's ancestry.  The cloths themselves are a heavy cotton or wool, with symbols and glyphs stitched in.  Children learn the symbol of the their clan is which is added at the top.  As they learn their ancestry, more names (often in symbolic form) are added.  Since this can get very long, often only the clan founder, and the person's most recent ancestors are listed.  Most families will have one or more prayercloths detailing the whole lineage, or as much as is known.  Upon maturity (age 13 for males), young adults add their own name to the end of the prayer cloth.  Often a grandmother will create a copy of the prayercloth and mount it upon leather, so it can be hung from a bridle or saddle.|

589|589|2004-04-02 13:54:13|shawnbarrick|[Magic] Rite of Invoking the Sovereign Prince of Knowledge|Rite of Invoking the Sovereign Prince of Knowledge  The Sovereign Prince of Knowledge is the Chlendi spirit of knowledge and secrets.  He has a true name, but it is the one piece of lore he shares with no one.  This invocation calls forth the Sovereign Prince to fill one's consciousness and aid in the learning of sorcery.  The invocation takes 4 hours during the proper astrological alignment and requires offerings of incense, blood, and flower petals.  During the ritual, the sorcerer speaks aloud in a variety of tongues, most of dead langauges, writhes upon the floor, and his eyes roll back and are glazed in yellow. The sorcerer will then have the ability to impart one spell into his personal collection, but at price of unhealing wounds that last for one or more days.  The invocation can not be reattempted until previous wounds have healed.  Mechanics: The incense and ritual material required for the invocation cost 10 gold (in raw currency).  To complete the invocation, the caster must make a Concentration check (DC=12+spell level).  If this is failed, nothing is learned, and the ritual materials are wasted.  The blood sacrifice results in a wound of d6 points per level of spell learned. This wound will not heal, short of a Wish spell, for one day per level of spell earned.  No further costs or time are necessary to learn and transcribe the spell.|

604|604|2004-04-15 22:13:52|shawnbarrick|A few notes...|- A traditional "mundane" (meaning something used by normal folks and note soothsayers) Heteri divination device are dice card from the bones of a tribal shaman, and engraved with astrological synbols.  - A Heteri broadsword is a heavy, single-edged slashblade.  It has a heavy curve or hook at the tip, and can be used either one or two handed.  - The main Heteri tribes: Naggai, Luggai, Polog.  There are three or four minor tribes.  Each tribe is made up of dozens of clans.  Naggai are the clans of the south (which includes Irosk's).  Luggai are the clans of the west (which includes Rikuu's).  - The traditional Heteri failware: "a blessing upon your horse", to which the proper response is: "and upon yours".  A few people: - Bajeron: Viktor's contacct in the Order of the Velvet Glove. - Seibaisle - head of the Rais-Worm Lodge in Bolog - Tybyar - Viktor's favourite pimp - Windswept Mane - the Heteri clan that own's your lodging.  - On the last handout, I listed "Kultanajhas" as the tutor of the Comte's son.  Ignore that.  The name is linguistically wrong for the teacher.  It will be corrected on the next handout (probably for when you return to Cuvauw), but the name "Kultanajhas" may come up in the next session and I want to avoid confusion.  - Another name for your notes "Melaikayin".  It will come up in the next session or two, and it's easier if you've seen the word before.  S.|

Rikuu track ed the blood-trail through the high grass and into an abandoned servants' quarters.  There they found their prey's escape path.

As the beast was in it's death  throes, some cultists came crawling down a tunnel, just to in time to be ensared in Nisik mystical webbing.

As I pointed out to Collin, try to think of these more than dice rerolls.  Spend a drama point, and the jail cell guard has dozed off.  Spend a drama point, and a distant member of your clan works the door at the Hive.  It's your (as a player) method of influencing the plot or setting out of character.  Issue the second: Advancement.  By my count, it's been four or five days since you left Cuvauw, and have fought some bandits, the burglars, and the proboscis-beast.  You've down some poking around and asking of questions.  Barring a change in direction, which is your character's perogative, expect to gain a level upon your return to Cuvauw, unless the happens significantly sooner or later than I expect.  Issue the third: Time & Pacing.  We had a request to try to wrap things up promptly at the end of the night.  My plan, with that in mind, is to get moving promptly at 7:00, and looking for a good ending place once I notice that we've hit 10:00.  As an example, last night we stop with the ensuing goblins attack as a cliffhanger, rather than playing it out as the last event. If we had gotten to that point a little earlier, we would have done the battle a called it a night.  But I think using cliffhangers will enabled us to get moving quickly each week.  Feel free to stick around after we've offically wrapped up to hand administrative, out of character, or other side issues than don't need to be handled with eveyone on hand (i.e. Irosk's chat with Guild officailly regarding Mutan's return).

What might help the development is if everyone, particularly players, start posting names and I'll try to outline to pronunciation.  As it progress, I'll probably start a side document that gives a line or two of explanation, with the idea of an Uod Encyclopedia.  Here's a start:  Uod - 'U-odd' or 'Uwad', not 'O-odd'.|

The theft of the mirror was for it's use in rituals, which further question included the word "Johud".     Checking their daily planned, a few meetings were scheduled for the day.  First off, theny headed to see Dr. Mupheaus Thoad, noted Physician, Scholar, Alchemist, Natural Philosopher, etc.  They discovered Glaiush's son Mutan was an excellent condition, and would be ready to return to Cuvauw after another day or two of rest.  Another patient, a young girl of noble means, was not so lucky.  Dr, Thoad had discovered a worm, and nearly vivisected the girl to trace it's development.  He found a small seed-like object which he believe to be to "egg" of sorts.  Leaving the patient to the doctor's care, they rested a bit and prepared for the evening meeting with Vidiban, the man spotted at the Pits sporting the symbol of Musthyoch.  He turned up at the subterranean tavern just after midnight, and joined the 'Knights for a drink and smoke.  He seemed relatively calm and polite compared to other cultists the group had met.  They discussed the pit fighting circuit a little and the philosophy of the followers of Musthyoch.  He claimed to not know of Chivat.  Before the usual White Worm/Johud/etc line of questioning began, goblin invaders burst the doors and into the bar...|

The rite takes approximately 30 minutes, and involves the burning of incense and speaking of holy words at the cardinal and cross-cardinal points, and finally the burying of a hunk of amberite at the center of the site.  It is traditional to seek the blessing ot Atejitl before construction buildings, else his anger will bring earthquakes, landslides and poor conditions.  Under other circumstances, the bless rite is performed upon campsites and temporary places of residence.

659|659|2004-05-06 12:31:33|Mark Simpson|UOD: The Week in Review|What a wonderfully restful week Our Heroes(tm) have had in lovely Bolog!   First, ambushed while still outside of town, we arrive triumphantly in front of the impressively ugly gates of the city with a captive Aesa in tow.  The town is ugly like the industrial sector of Cuvauw is ugly, but without the saving grace of being nicer at night.  It is at dusk on the 23rd of Lilvun that The Knights of Plausible Deniability enter the City of Bolog.  The next day is Rikku and Nisik's Big Adventure(tm) in which they kick some goblin butt and take some loot.  Viktor decides to buy Aesa instead of letting her be hung.  While it is a noble deed (or perhaps because it is and he fears the loss of his new extra spell book), Nisik disagrees with the decision.  With outstanding luck the jail guard is incredibly forgetful and fails to make Viktor pay for his new slave.  Also this night Rikku learns the hard way that 'a tour of the city' is not a good idea.  The next morning we bring Mutan to the very knowledgable Doctor Mupheus Thoad.  The good Doctor is very learned, intelligent and so on... and will surely help (and so on...) the poor boy out.  So with that issue out of their minds they contact the Baron, who tells them about brewing trouble.  That evening Nisik studies while the others go gambling in the 'pits' (where they drink, relax, meet new and interesting people (Tentacle-Boy and the Priest of Mustyach) and generally have a great old time while poor Nisik is attacked and has the mirror stolen from him!).  In the wee hours of the 26th they retrieve the mirror and fight a disturbingly unsanitary looking creature in the tunnels under the city.  The rest of the day is spent resting, interrogating a prisoner (no not Aesa, a _new_ prisoner), visiting Dr. Thoad and seeing his lovely specimen and waiting to meet with a Priest of Mustyach at midnight (it is assumed that he like everyone else not buried in Viktor's root cellar is an enemy).  The meeting with the priest was merely a prelude for that night's big event: a full on goblin and lizard hour rumble!  Nisik once again proves that he can in fact be useful (if he is prepared to be useful that day).  Furthermore it is determined, quite oddly, that the priest might actually be an ally even though he is not buried in Viktor's root cellar.  On the 27th the a temple is broken into and destroyed and no one bothered to invite the group!  How rude.  Nisik finds a Nog with a gun; the Heroes find out the Viddebon is still alive and knows _something_ but is now gone; and a Rambo-like montage scene leads up some skull-cracking under the city (however once again a cult is destroyed before they even get there!).  Nisik takes damage!  Irosk deals damage (more than 1 or 2 points even), Viktor is Heroic, and Rikku performs some good Longbow Diplomacy and the Bad Guy gets away. Loot is found but it is too big to carry.  The next day is spent limping in pain and Nisik buys a smart Nog while Irosk makes mineral rights deals.  On the 29th Our Heroes(tm) leave the city behind them on a caravan bound for Cuvauw, with a load of Bologium and Amberite, a no-longer-sick Mutan and two servants.  They also leave behind two temples destroyed, two allies and at least one enemy.  In all it was a good week.  The week has caused the heroes to rethink their hypothesis that everyone not buried in Viktor's root cellar cannot be an ally and they have determined that 'The Enemy of my Enemy is still my Enemy'.  Also meta-game it is determined that you just leave a natural 3... it doesn't get any better with a reroll.|

701|701|2004-05-18 16:30:11|Nathaniel Bennett|A letter to Nisik|My old friend, his Eminence Nisik the Great and Wise,   Greetings! It was with great excitement that I read your recent letter, though I can't for the life of me figure out why, so many years later, you'd want me to recount the events of our return to Cuvauw after Bolog. However I am happy to comply. Also, congratulations on yet another new child! You and Asa must be very happy. Or at any rate she is very fertile.  We returned to Cuvauw at the very end of the month. The wind blew cold and the sun shone colder. We immediately made for the Commerce Guild where we were greeted warmly. Father and Son were reunited and we were asked to return in the morning for our just desserts. I excused myself to return to Elle and the Manor, and I believe Riku returned home, Irosk stayed at the Guild and you took a room at the Earl's Dead Fish with your new nog servant Mr. Whats his name.   In the morning Riku, Irosk and I met back at the Guild (you had remained in your room to continue some arcane study) where we were again greeted warmly. After some small talk Gliush presented us with a great mound of gold bars (valued at about 500 gold coins for each of us), and some fancy fur cape like shawl type things. And good booze. One thing about Gliush, he was always generous with the good booze. The mark of a gentleman, I have always said. I always could tell the Conte was a piece of crap based on how stingy he was with his booze. But he got his, didn't he! Har!  Anyway, we collected a small portion of our booty and made arrangements for the Commerce Guild to keep the rest for us in a bankerly sense. Then we went to see Vanos. Riku was always worried about Vanos betraying us if we didn't keep him fat and happy. And look how that turned out. Bastard. Anyway, Vanos had hired some replacement guards who were pretty sloppy, and had reinforced his office after his last encounter with the folks not buried in my root cellar. Sounded like not much had been going on in our absence from town, and Vanos didn't know much of use about the ghoul cults were had recently learned about. Ah, the good old days of blissful ignorance and stupidity, eh?   I, with the help of Riku and Irosk, broached the idea of bringing a pit fighting franchise to Cuvauw and hosting it at the Asylum with Vanos as the manager. He liked the idea and we made some plans to have Riku's seer go over the place, and to start to tidy it up to host the fights. Vanos was a little worried that some of his higher class clientele might be bothered by the attention, but we were confident we could get around that small problem.  That's pretty much all that happened in those first days back. Days I like to think of as the Calm Before the Shit Storm.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Your friend and servant,  Lord Viktor d'Auberge of Balanconth    	 		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

Simply because I want to come up with something of my own.  There are alchemical processes to address the qualities of normally mundane materials.  Lots of ideas, but not a whole lot figured out.  Bits one could stumble upon, but aren't widely known.  Rather carefully guarded secrets by a noble family with alchemists in their employ.  Nothing you'd find plentiful enough to outfit an army.  There is, however, what's referred to as "white steel" made from ores mined in the hills surrounding Jakinta (in the far southeast, just north of the Mindat homeland), which is said to be as strong as fine steel, but much lighter.  You can consider those Heteri broadswords (that Glaiush gave you) masterwork, in case I didn't mention it.|

Velociraptors?   Dragons and velociraptors aren't lizards, or even reptiles. Dinosaurs are usually classified as their own type of animal sharing features with mammals and reptiles (a la birds-not mammals or reptiles). Dragons are probably in the same boat-somewhere outside the realm of mammal or reptile.  The deal with lizards is that they use the same muscles to move and to contract and expand their rib cages (they have no diaphrams so the ribs act as lung bellows). The result is lizards can't run and breath at the same time so they run, stop, run, stop. I don't bring this up to show off my lizard anatomy knowledge (always popular with the ladies) but rather because it means riding a big lizard would be a figurative and literal pain in the ass.   >  > Have I ever told you the story about the dizzy > giraffe?

Yup. And liquers, as well as herbal stuff like anisette, chartreuse, absinthe, etc.  Not sure what the Chlendi drink.   > Dragons and velociraptors aren't lizards, or even > reptiles.

Dragons > are probably in the same boat-somewhere outside the > realm of mammal or reptile.   I don't have an informed understanding on the current state of dinosaur-avian theories.  But the larger lizards, like some that the Mindat use, would be more like a small dinosaur than a large iguana.    > The deal with lizards is that they use the same > muscles to move and to contract and expand their rib > cages (they have no diaphrams so the ribs act as lung > bellows).

I'm guess Uod's big "lizards" would have a different structure. I'm open to plausible explanations, but my biggest point would be that 'giant lizards are frickin' cool'.   > > Have I ever told you the story about the dizzy > > giraffe? >  > Nope.

Most of them are specifically described.  It's part of the creation myth. Jotesh (Utan's father) is one of the old gods.  One or two others may still be around, depending on what Shaman you talk to.      > 7) Does Heter exist in ruins now, like Babylon or Angor Wat  > in our world, or in a mythological sense, like Atlantis?   Mythological sense.  It would be in the mountains north or east of Bolog, but considering the time scale, it might not be more than a village if it did exist.   > 8) The Mindat are know to have slain their gods, but has any  > mortal ever ascended to godhood?   They don't really think in terms of godhood anymore.  They do talk about "ascension", though that's not necessarily the right word.   > 9)  Is there thought to be a source for magic in the world,  > or is it just accepted as the way the world works by common  > people, like gravity?   There's a couple sources.  It's a pretty big question.  Traditional Maetah sorcery sees "omnessence" in natural and material items that was infused with the energy of one of their gods.  The Chlendi see energy in the spirits and the stars.  Most Mindat would answer that it's untapped power within oneself.    > 10) Do the Heteri have any customs concerning hospitality to  > ones enemies?   Yup.  If you *invite* someone into your camp/home you are obligated to feed them and their horses to the best of your ability, and provide a seat at your fire.  Notice that Glaiush always gave you booze when you came by.  They are "considered" a member of your clan while in your care.  ------  Again, these are the quick answers.  I'm printing all these out so I can more deeply address the others.  What would be really cool is: get one of you (rotating or whatever) to do the session writeup, and then each we'll compile 10 questions inspired by what transpired.  Then I'll try to have asnwers for all of those each week.  S.|

What is the color pallette gneerally used for Chlendi clothes?   Dark shades.  Indigo, mossy greens, and browns.  Bright colours attract insects. Blue and purple are the signs of wealth or status.    > 2.)  Do Hetari use silverware at their meals?   Nope.  Just a knife.  In modern times some of the more cosmopolitan nobles have though.   > 3.)  Is there a hiearchy of preferable horse colors in Hetari society?   Not particularly.  They know their horses well enough to stick with quality. Black horses are considered unlucky though: "a fine horse, but she might throw you".   > 4.)  Where are the main trade route from Curvau?   The river west to Minkaraph is the big one.  The other routes are south to Akklai Point and Givos.  Givos is basically a jumping off point for river trade to the south.    > 5.)  How are the Mindat viewed in the North (or wherever we are now)   Severely dislike by most Heteri, unless they have some sort of economic connection.  The Chlendi distrust them (based on history).  Most cultures don't get their lack of clans.  Nobles in "the South" see them as curious and quaint.   > 6.)  Do the gods of the various pantheons cooperate with or  > combat against each other?   Tricky question.  There's some overlap in the Maetah and Heteri deities.    > 7.)  Is there any seafaring?   Not a lot simply because of geography.  The Fog prevents easy access to the Shn (who you haven't encountered yet).  Along the North Sea coast, the weather can get nasty, but the Maetah were originally a seafaring people and still do extensively fishing.  A lot of trade runs along the coast of Ghikarn'gai through to the Mindat homeland.    > 8.)  What are the main staple grains in the north?  in the south?   Git is the major crop in the north.  I'll post a writeup if I don't have a link already. Wheat and barley are also grown.  Traditonal rices are the staple in the south, though I really haven't though too much about their agriculture.   > 9.)

Will we ever be able to pronounce your names, and keep all the  > cultures seperate?   I try to spell them phonetically whenever possible.  Heteri is very guturally and Maetah has some softly or unpronounced consonants. Chlendi can be just plain hard.  Give me some troublesome words and I'll add them to the pronunciation list.  Uod Cultural Shorthand:  - Heteri: If the Mongols had won. - Mindat: Arabic + Chinese - Maetah: Northern European plus a bit of Japan - Chlendi: Arabic + Mayan in a swamp  Not truly accurate, but if you think of them in these terms, you won't be completely off base.  I've got some "If I was Heteri" type documents in embryonic form that I should really get back to...  If things seem to blur together a little bit, it's a intentional conceit.  I've started you in a little bit of a melting pot, as getting people to play a Mindat right off the bat would be hard.  You've seen a little of more traditional Heteri culture, but only gotten a hint of Maetah or Eskla (the mixed culture of the south).    S.|

That's why you've got people with  a smattering of noble titles all over the Rhiat (the Baron, the Comte,  the Duke in Vennosat, etc).    > * What other 'Realms' exist?  (Dream realm, spirit realm ...)   The Chlendi only recognize the spirit "otherworld", and see what others  would call 'dimensions' as a subset of that.  Various cultures have  different views, but none as widely or emperically known.   > * Why do the Chlendi favour the swampy Ramush area?  Is it their >   traditional living conditions or is it all that is left for them?   Part of it is tradition.  Chlendi are crappy farmers, which was some of  the motivation for enslaving the Maetah. Part of it is spiritual.  They  built communities based on astrology and the presence of Amberite.  Asklor, for example, is not in a swampy area.|

727|604|2004-05-24 15:38:44|shawnbarrick|A few notes...|A few notes:  - Activity of the Commerce Guild (With inspiration from the Tekumel Sourcebook).  What does the Commerce Guild actually do?  They are the ultimate middlemen.  Under the strict laws of the old Empire, one could not transport goods of another outside of the town borders unless licensed by the Commerce Guild.  Only they could run caravans, though (by law) you could transport and resell your own products.  The Commerce Guild also manages loans, moneychanging, and banking.  For their own safety, a noble would often exchange a large sum of money for a Guild "writ of credit" before leaving town, then "cash out" for the same amount (minus the service fee) at the final destination or stops along the way.  In many towns and cities, the Commerce Guild manages local markets, keeping an eye out for thieves, charging for marketspace, handling transport from warhouses, etc.     - Chlendi Diet: Snake, fowl, swamprat, fish, and shellfish, as well as the variety of fruits and vegetables in the swamp form the basis of the diet. They are masters of finding the edible algae and fungi of the region, and aren't above partaking in the delicacy of large beetles on occasion.  Common beverages are a distilled liquor from swamp reed "marrow", herbal concoctions and aromatic teas from the bark and leaves of swamp trees.  Traditional Chlendi "table-ware" is a pair of double-ended tools with prongs on one end, and small knife edges on the other.  They are used for both eating, serving, and food prepartion.  Use of these a refined skill a step beyond the use of chopsticks, and being able to eat a fine meal without betraying etiquette is considered a sign of maturity.  Imagine what the Chlendi think of Heteri barbarians eating with their fingers!  ------------------  A few customs:  - The traditional Heteri challenge is to spit at the feet of your foe.  This is a serious offense, and doing so is casue for drawing steel, except by the closest of friends.  - Before battle, Heteri will bathe the hooves of their horses in blood for luck.  - The rare Chlendi will be born with violet-blue eyes.  This is considered an auspicious omen.  In general, Chlendi consider the colour red to be unlucky.  - In the civilized cities of the south, to wear a sword indoors is an offense to the host, indicating that you don't trust him or his ability to protect you.  - Minkush River (lit. 'Blood of the Mindat') - renamed after the Chlendi defeated the Mindat at Minkarapht.  Hordes of Mindat corpses were thrown downstream in the river.  Each year to commemorate the battle, items of red colour and thrown in the river to flow downstream.  - Before the dominance of the Thedine, Maetah legend held that Uod was infused with magic from the blood of a creator god.  All of the old rites began by a ceremonial bloodletting by the head officiant.  To this day, when important oaths are, the palm is cut or nicked.  Convicted criminals will have a slash upon their cheek or forehead made as the conviction is read.|

Horsetheft is/was seen as stealing a *very* valuable item.  Not that most of the populations have become sedentary, horses are still need and honoured, but aren't an absolute necessity for survival.  But I'm sure many Heteri men would rather you steal their wife.  Even in the "old days", the tribes would raid each other.  I suppose it would be an honour to have a "horse worthy of stealing".    > 2) Is dueling common among the Heteri?  Need it be to the  > death, or will first blood suffice?  How about other contests  > instead of combat, such as feats of strength or a horse race?  >  Do the rules change when dealing with outsiders?   The concept is common - proving superiority.  But not some much in the formal, noble sense - rapiers, pistols at dawn.  They'd be happy to trounce you in the dirt, leave a nice scar, and remind me you of it. Fighting to the death would be only for extreme circumstances, but if you spit at someone's feet, I wouldn't count on being recognizable when the situation is settled.  S.|

Can't say that these are great but no one else has put any in...  slashing: the blade rips through the fabric on your chest and slices into your skin... the blood wells up into the thin wound and starts to drip down slowly.

Details are scarce, but it was said to involve a couple nobles and a dispute about a woman.  No mention of injuries (or the deaths of any guards).  Most of the out-of-town guests of the party stay in Cuvauw for a few days, then leave.  However, it seems that the a delegation of Argaevaligne is sticking around, and work has begun on a new temple of Thedine. One the Thedine airships is now "docked" on the Comte's grounds.   When you return to Vidiban's townhouse, you find it *largely* undisturbed.  Someone had pried open the lock on the front door, but nothing appears missing (not that you took an inventory the previous night).  His body, or what remains of it, is still at the foot of the cellar steps.  The fumes from the alchemical equipment have dispersed. You find some clothes, moldly furniture, and items for food preparation. Contents of the "lab" will be handled separately.  Upon returning home, Viktor will find a polite note from a visiting noble's retainer, who looks to purchase Aesa for a respectable price.  In 12 days, upon the New Moon, the astrological factors (name a minor conjunction involving the planet Iaovyus) are inline to dig up the Baron.  S.|

From the OOC perspective, I've never really developed her well, which is solely my fault.  Unlike a nog, it's harder to have her tag along in the background.

Compurgation meant that the person accused of a crime was required to swear an oath that he was innocent and, depending on the seriousness of the offense, he might be required to persuade a greater or lesser number of the leading members of his kindred to swear the same oath along with him. The may seem similar to the modern practice of offering character witnesses, but was really quite different. If it turned out that the defendant were lying about his injury he and all of his compurgators were liable to suffer the same punishment. In addition, the leaders of a kindred might not be willing to places the lives and properties of members of their clan at risk in order to support a person who they knew not to be of the highest character. So if was that some people were abandoned by their own kindred and had to flee the vengeance of the relatives of their victim."|

Duels are always fun, as is watching Rikku get apoplectic, but again seems only minorly related to our previous exploits.   >  > > 4. Head east - Heteri civil war.  Have fun.

However the idea of being surrounded by so many Heteri is a major downer.  How about we stay in Cuvau and become major power players? We start fighting stables in the Hospital, wage an invisible war against the Church of Thedine and the Conte, and Viktor gets to take his shot at Vushu?   	 		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

I think i agree with Nate, going North does not seem likely but, if the plot went that way Nisik has a contact in Nipend that needs to be followed up with, perhaps aiding his researches.   > 2.

This is the one i thought most likely for Nisik, following up on the White Worm stuff, trying to find Kultanhash (or however the ancient City of Sorcerors was called).   > 3.

If the plot needed to head this way, reasons could be created for Nisik to head back toward home... The anniversary of the Naming Day of his Clan Head/Grandmother/Father; important family business; must report on the successful killing of^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hdelivery to the Baron.   > 4.

Ok Nisk has a reason to go that way as well then.   > Give me your thoughts.  The McGuffin can point in any direction.  Yeah, a game of Spin the McGuffin!  South and perhaps East seem most likely to me; they have the most immediate reference to Nisik's interest in the White Worm Problem.|

Making a heroic name for myself is alluring, but ifyou perform great deeds, and no Heteri saw it, did it really happen?    > 3. Head west - Cities of the Minkush Valley.  Fancy Hats.

That's the direction I'd like to go, back to the Motherland, and following up on the white worm plotline.       That aside, the idea of staying in Cauvau has possibilities, and we do have a few things to tie up in town.  Between the four, I'd say head East. -- Collin|

849|849|2004-07-23 14:06:52|widderslainte|Sexual Dimorphism in Nogs|A few brief notes on Sexual Dimorphism [being cribbed Dr. Mupheaus Thoad, with tangental ramblings expurgated]  While most male nogs are 30-36" in height, females tend to smaller size, closer to 24".  They typically possess softer features than males, with rounded noses, ears, and chins, as well as wider hips to aid in the spouting of infant nogs.  Hair, on the head or face, is exceedingly rare, even to a lesser extent than in males.  It is thus easy for those not readily familiar with nogs to be unable to differentiate between the sexes.  When unclothed, female nogs are seen to have pairs teats for nursing, with some possessing two, four, or even six pair.  Both sexes gave a brown or tan skin in the regions of the Rhiat, but it is common for the skin of females to taken on a reddish glow when emotionally charge, an effect not unlike that of human blushing.|

This game (like most roleplaying games) is all about risk, danger, adventure, and intrigue.  Snce you signed on to play, you have to accept that bad things may happen to your characterm including madness, maiming and death."  ...     "UA is a horror game.  It's about uncertainty and tough choices. Really hugh levels of competence reduce the horror.  If your rely on  your 75% firearms skill to see you through, enemies aren't terrifying: They're just paper tigers.    If skills seem low, don;t put trust in your skills. Push things in your favor. Don't like your initiative? Plan ambushes! Struggle seem too low? Out number your opponents! Can't get help with just a low Charm roll?

(also known as 'the post that messes with Mark's character')  - You eat indoors whenever possible, but sit around a small table on the floor. - Your largest meal of the day is dinner, which is usually before sunset. - Virtually everything is food, if prepared properly.  You eat plants, fruits, teas and stews flavoured with fungi and bark.  Reptiles, fish, fowl, and amphibians are all considered food. - Your home is a one room hut with a wooden floor.  It stands on pillars above the swampwater.  How high depends on the time of year and local waterlevel fluctuation rates. - No one owns the land.  All property that you can not carry yourself is own by the clan.  Technically, your clan owns the hut you live in, but no one owns the land and swamp beneath it. - Serious crimes (murder, theft, rape) are punished by death.  The mortal incarnation is only a brief stage in the lifecycle of the soul, and the spirit world will ensure that the judgement is just. - Chlendi have no compunctions about slavery, and while it was used heavily in the old times (see Maetah), it is not terribly practical now.  - You were born at home, or in a local clanhouse, with the aid of a midwife or shaman. - You were given a name at birth, and a new name upon reaching maturity. - As teenager you took the clan induction rite.  You were lead to an far off section of the swamp for a vision-quest type of ordeal, where you would speak with the spirits.   - Marriages are arranged, usually between members of differents line of the same clan, or as alliance between clans.  You've known you future spouse since your induction rite. - A widowed woman will marry her husband's brother is she still has young children. - Polygamy is practiced but rare. - Homosexuality is not frowned upon, but should be handled discreetly.  You have your spouse to consider. - Each year, the clan meets for a weeklong gathering near a traditional burial ground.  Far off lineages don't always make it every year, but it's dishonourable if they don't make an effort.  It's a casual, relaxing event, interrupted by solemn ceremonies after dark.  - When speaking with someone, you feel uncomfortable if they are within 3 feet of you. - When at a market, you are expected to haggle by denigrating the quality of the product.   - You can name 90% of the constellations and stars in the sky. - Unless it's nighttime, arriving at an appointment within an hour of it's schedule time is considered "on time".  After dusk, it's a different matter. - The only "race" is Chlendi.  There are Chlendi, and everyone else.  You recognize that these other forms distinguish themselves by hair and eye colour, and will indulge their delusion taxonomies as necessary.|

You can take a look at a vanilla character sheet here: http://worldofdarkness.com/downloads/WorldofDarknessSheet.pdf  We'll have to see how the merits, flaws, and combat perks look once I get the book.  One "dot" represents a familiarity with the skill, and two "dots" an average level of competence.  We've got a bunch of other White Wolf material to fill in any gaps.  I think the characters will transfer pretty well, though Nisik will need some fiddling to get the magic right.|

Any way we want.  In the older games there literally a dozen systems. Most of them involve some sort of spell point type analogue, and a "skill check" of sorts to succeed.    In some form, you probably have a "skill" of Conjuring or Summoning.  As you get more points in it, you could summon bigger/better/more stuff. They would stick around for "a scene".  Storyteller doesn't usually go for measuring effects by the turn/minute/whatever.|

889|889|2004-08-22 21:42:57|widderslainte|Uod: The Nogging|So... I grabbed my copy of the new Storyteller system rulebook yesterday morning.  Apparently, they've blown through most of the stock at Gencon, and I'm glad I had them reserve me a copy at Hobby Bunker, as they sold everything they had.  All the meat (for our purposes), is in the Storyteller Core Rulebook which is available online for $12 or $13 (in a freakin' hardcover even).  So far, I'm pretty impressed.  Very streamlined.  Attack/damage/etc are  all handled with one roll, and some of the clunk and weirdness about the  old versions of the system have been straightened out.  The more I look,  the more elegance I find.  Makes Unisystem look even more like an  awkward knock-off.  The fact that it handles armour damage absorption,  instant kills, and still beating someone to death with your fists make  me happy.  Also a decent way of intergrated all the old-style WoD backgrounds,  merits/flaws, and how we could encompass D&D style feats.  More propoganda later.  Think of some wacky scenario and we can play  with dice on Tuesday.  S.|

I flipped through the Storyteller's book and the Vampire book at Harrison's in Salem this weekend.  What I read looked good.  	As to scenarios, we can try a few mock combats to get the dice system worked, and perhaps a few runs through skill checks.  Hm...Uod Olympics perhaps?  Hungry dog vs. blind nog redux?  	Collin|

Hm...Uod Olympics perhaps?  Hungry dog vs. blind nog redux?   Definitely.  I'll get some print-outs and copies of the rules summaries and synopsis and we can fiddle around.  Earlier I was concerned about how to work in an balance things like feats and magic, but now I don't see it as a problem.  If people (in general, not for Uod), have any interest in a rules-lighter, non d20 system, I highly recommend grabbing the WoD corebook while it's still cheap.  It's really a step up in the evolution of the family of dice pool systems.  I'd be awfully tempted to try a conversion the next time I ran Shadowrun.|

So it costs points to be a sorcerer AND you have to spend points on paths? Could get expensive...  You could have each level be the max level of ritual that can be learned rather then have each level determine how many incantations/paths you can learn.   > Merit: Chlendi Sorcery >  > * - Spirit sight, Astrology > ** - Can call up Spirits > *** - Conjure beasts and spirits in physical form > **** - Move through spirit realm, ? > ***** - Bind spirits to physical forms, ?

Could get expensive...   Exactly.  Yes, otherwise it's *damn* cheap.  The costs aren't exponential are Chargen, so it benefits someone who's character is a dedicated sorceror out of the gate.  Otherwise, compare to having a nog (retainer) and being buddies with a city gate guard (contact) in merit cost (2 points).  Nisik being Awareness 3, Chlendi Sorcery 2 at start leaves him with 2 more points of merits, but room for growth.  I'm assuming he got to Sorceror 3 through XP.    > You could have each level be the max level of ritual > that can be learned rather then have each level > determine how many incantations/paths you can learn.   I was thinking:  Awareness 1 = level one incantations/rituals Awareness 2 = Can do Level 1-2 incant's & rituals Awareness 3 = Knows one path.  Can do Level 1-3 incant's & rituals Awareness 3 = Can learn additional paths.  Can do Level 1-4 incant's & rituals   > > Merit: Chlendi Sorcery > >  > > * - Spirit sight, Astrology > > ** - Can call up Spirits > > *** - Conjure beasts and spirits in physical form > > **** - Move through spirit realm, ? > > ***** - Bind spirits to physical forms, ? >  > I'd suggest that each level includes spirit summoning, > with each level determining the power of the spirit.   Don't forget our new "Monster Summon X" equivalent lasts for a single scene instead of seconds per caster level. Since we're skipping that level anyways, Nisik would have been able to do it from our first session.|

I mean, really,  whenever you see something that doesn't make sense? A wizard did it.  The way they work, is a young wizard picks a group of pawns and goes  around with them, training to them to be good little tools for him. He  sets his apparent power to match theirs. Then, when he 'retires' to the  'academic life', he's got a squad of incredibly efficient killers to  work for him. Of course, these sometimes get killed off in feuds with  other wizards, then he has to go to bars and give missions to more  unskilled peons until they're good enough to be effective tools.  The clerics? Oh they really are that limited. If they channel too much  divine power through their bodies in a single day, they get fried. They  have to build up a tolerance.

921|921|2004-09-06 15:10:22|shawnbarrick|Givos, Part I|Givos -----  Givos is a coastal fishing town, traditionally disputed by the Balancont and the rules of Teldarpha (in eastern Ghikarn'gai).  While its harbour welcomes foreign vessels, the rocky outcroppings that populate it prevented the community from become a major trade port, and remains largely the province of fishing vessels.  It has become a popular stopping point for seaborn trade vessels, who anchor in the outer bay and take small skiffs into town for supplies and refreshments.  Currently occupied by the Goblin Queen's forces, it is nominally rules by Mivuhwul Isasnias Koman, the middle-aged burgher of fine ancestry who acts as a puppet to the local Captain Nivinak.  Isanias demonstrated his loyalty by killing the previous Mivuhweul in the city square.  Givos, for an unknown radon, was one of the first communities targetted when the goblins rose to the surface.  Despite the crumbling walls and downtrodden residents, Givos still welcomes peaceful travellers and merchants, so long as they keep clear of the goblin occupying force.  Discreet travellers can find lodging at the White Witch inn, two blooks in from the east gate.  The sorcerer's lodge of Duslandgarot is still active, but only with a skeleton staff.  They are said to be in the good graces of the gobllin Queen.  The city is a mix of Eskla and Heteri ethnicities, and most buildings are small houses of stone and peat, barely able to withstand the stormy summer season.|

The next opportunity will be in a month (at the new moon), but only at a hilltop location a weeks ride to the south. A new meat body will be necessary.  No word from the Baron himself. - Word has spread from the south of Goblin incursions in the farming villages or traveler's waypoints north of Akklai Point. - The Commerce Guild is frustrated by increased resistance to their trade utilization of Akklai Point, which had never been a problem in earlier years dealing with the Goblin occupation forces.  Glaiush is curious about the possibility of running eastern caravans out through the fishing port at Givos.  The "more": Last night we finished up the characters, in their embryonic form.  Everyone got 45 xp beyond base, with more to come.  Ignoring the setup, we jumped into a midnight bandit attack upon the fellows to kick the tires some more on the new system.  The magic system will need some adjustment (primarily on the drain) and some effects clarification.  We also noted:  - Everything reduces the dice pool, not the final successes. - Armor is your friend. - Outnumbering is nasty. - Concealment, surprise, and other tactical options are worth the effort. - Use willpower.  Upcoming Schedule: Thurs 9/16 - Uod Thurs 9/23 - Uod, maybe in Burlington Thurs 9/30 - NO SESSION Thurs 10/7 - Uod, in Burlington  S.|

Nisik, who had been in attempting to teach Lum some of the basics of Chlendi Cosmology (which Lum is entirely failing to grasp) and recieving unwanted advice on this subject from Kivot, turns to Viktor...  "... hmmm oh yes, the body.  Of course we will need one, his previous body was reduced to dust.  That is not to say that we should dispose of that dust, it may still be useful; at least an interesting conversation piece for the mantlepiece don't you think?..."  He finally notices Viktor stare: "What?  will procuring a new body be a problem?  I had thought that you gentlemen", gesturing to include Irosk adn Rikku, "were quite skilled at the creation of bodies?  I had not factored into my calculations any time for the procurement of a body given my assumption as to your skills in this regard.  If you are not notifying me that you are in fact, not so skilled, then perhaps it would be prudent to acquire a body post-haste."  "Where to find a body...", Nisik muses, Kivot quorks something in Chlendi, "of course!  The Guards have bodies!", (the guards look quite disturbed by this outburst from the Sorceror).  "What I mean, of course" he continues in a more conspiratorial tone, "is that the bandits and guards which were until the ambush last night pre-corpses, to use the technical term, are now in fact corpses entirely, they have undergone the necessary transition.  If one of them could be exhumed i could perform certain rituals; and along with particular ungents created by our esteemed Herbalist Rikku (at my direction of course) we could perserve them for later use in the re-incarnation of the Baron."  "Of course, if that were not possible, then of course we would need to find a pre-corpse to use.  Perhaps one of the gaurds, or Aesa?"|

Link the number of successes needed to the level of the spell?   > > - Drain is a little too random.   We could link the amount of drain to the 'level' of the spell cast.  That way the drain is predictable with the Resolve roll potentially reducing it.     Rituals already have  a 'level' associated with them; the number of dots.  For other things like the Chlendi Sorcery Path having higher dots lets to you do different sorts of things, so that would be the level  of that spell.  After the player decided what they want to do, the GM determines how much drain it would be, if it is not clear.   >  > Also we had discussed but did not nail down a means to allow the mage > to cast spells more powerful than normal which could cause the drain > to be lethel instead of bruising.   If we go with the above drain idea then if Nisik  would declare his intention to try to put to sleep not just  these 4 guys, but  8 people, over a wider area... that sounds more like a level 2 spell so it would have higher drain, plus it would be lethel drain since Nisik is really pushing it.   >  > I also like the idea of including a penalty of some sort when wearing > armor, but that can be dealt with when the core of this magic system > is resolved.   This could be as simple as reducing the dice pool by the armor number.  Magic armor would have lesser effect and 'Mage Armor' spell has no such effect.|

That should be simple.  Whatever dice calculation we used to figure drain still stands, but when you "overclock", you just mark down lethal boxes instead.    > I also like the idea of including a penalty of some sort when  > wearing armor, but that can be dealt with when the core of  > this magic system is resolved.   It's not a big issue to me, but simple counting a dice pool penalty equal to the armor value sounds fine to start.|

Hmm.  I'll have to let that percolate in my brain.    I like the basic idea of what we were using last night, but Resolve alone didn't scale enough.  I want to make sure that even cast a "1st level" spell has some possibility of drain, but that one bad roll won't know you right out if you try something a little more.    How's this:  (Like before) Base drain is the number of dice you use to cast.  Once again your Resolve attribute (and any successes you care to spare from casting) reduce this.  *But*, instead of taking "X drain levels" minus resolve, your resolve reduces drain as a dice pool, which is then rolled to see how many drain level are done to you.  That probably sounds confusing.  Example:  1.  Nisik cast a spell with 6 dice.  Gets three successes, and saves one to help with drain. 2.  Nisik's Resolve is 3.  Add thar success from Step 1, for a total of 4 dice. 3.  This is a penalty to the Drain Pool, which is now reduced to 2 dice. 4.  I roll two dice.  Each success is a level of bruise damage.     > This could be as simple as reducing the dice pool by the  > armor number.  Magic armor would have lesser effect and 'Mage  > Armor' spell has no such effect.   Exactly, though I want to collapse Shield and Mage Armour into one incantation that doesn't sound as dorky as "Mage Armour".|

We'd have to double back to Cauvau and dry-gulch the Compte's son, which Rikuu is all for doing, and drag him back in a manageable state with us.  We could even bleed the mindat for spite's sake (or wrath to be more exact).  I think we'd do better to make use of the bandit we captured and plan some later revenge for the Compte's son.  	Perhaps we can save his demise until we triumphantly return from the south, with a caravan of riches and goblin slaves to Cauvau, then have Viktor challenge the Compte's son to a duel.  Better yet, arrange for the Compte's son and the mindat to fight each other in the pits below the asylum for our drunken amusement.  	Collin|

What'sMisik's usual casting pool? 6 or 7 dice with a Resolve of 3? That means he's rolling 3-4 dice for drain. If 2 dice gets 1 success half the time then that averages 3/4-1 drain per casting.

Generally, yes.  Don't know if it scales enough.  I don't want it completely bonkers (cast magic missile, lose consciousness), but I don't want it too predictable (I can cast 5 fireballs at Strength X without losing consciousness).   We're on the right track, but maybe tweak it up a touch.  Then...we can add fetishes and other fun stuff.  S.|

With exploding 10s the Average Drain per Casting is actually higher, but the C I got in Statistics isn't good enough for me to be able to add that to my calculations. If we remove Resolve then we add on average 2-3 dice but we also remove the Resist Drain factor. Probably if the Resolve was a roll instead of removing dice then we'd get results you want, but that adds a lot of dice and isn't very elegant.    		 _______________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

1008|1008|2004-10-18 11:08:24|widderslainte|A small summation of recent events.|From Nisik's research, it became apparent that the failure to reunite the Baron with his body was due to a an error in the astrological correspondence.  Something had changed in the Baron's location in the dream realm, which ties in with some of the dreams Nisik has had.  After further calculations, Nisik believe the Baron could be returned to a *new* physical form if the ritual was performed at a certain date, a lunar cycle forward, at a hilltop location to the south near Akklai Point in Balancont.  The group decided to head south.  Much of Cuvauw was beginning to close up for the winter, and the possibilities of the near South were intriguing.  The Goblin Conquest brought visions of a war economy to Irosk, and new avenues of trade to his Guild.  After visiting Bolog, Rikku was beginning to have delusions of Heteri grandeur, and recovering ancestral lands would be a good selling point in the plan to raise a horde.  Nisik... Always seems to find trouble, so his location didn't really matter.  Viktor saw potential in the wealth and family home in Akklai Point, and had somehow been befriended by the Order of the Velvet Glove, a conglomeration of Maetah and Eskla families with similar aims.  Arriving in Givos, they found the town largely empty.  There was still a population there - fisherman were fishing, and the few remaining noble and wealthy had holed in their homes.  The forces from the subterranean goblin realm had taken control of Givos, with the assistance of the Mivehwul (Mayor), who also provided a few hundred Heteri (the lower class) to the goblins for slave labor.  Other townsfolk (including much of the town guard) had bought in with the goblins and were harassing locals and farmers almost as north as Cuvauw.  Along with the goblins came a fever plague that has slowly spread amongst the locals, evidencing itself as a blue rash.  So far it appears more debilitating than life threatening, though "plague masks" and a variety of snake-oil cures are sold all over town.  The only thing more popular than plague-talk are the daily hangings.  Their first night in town, Viktor was approaching by Egoen, his (apparent) contact from the Order of the Velvet Glove.  While the Knights of Plausible Deniability had planned to pass through town, maybe stir up a little ruckus, a few local operatives thought Viktor would be arriving as their savior.  Later meeting Egoen down by the docks, he tried to cajole them into grander schemes, involving assassination and such, while Viktor had his mind set on Arson.  Shortly after they arrived, the "troops" joined them: a smattering of dock workers and some violent Heteri rabble.  The group set off for the slave pens, in an effort that will ultimately fail.   How, why, and who survives will be determined Thursday night. Anyone who can't make it may end up *in* the slave pens.  Or worse yet, as a host in the food pen.|

1068|1068|2004-11-18 11:15:54|widderslainte|Recent Events|Here's a refresher of recent events:  With the assistance of Egoen, a local contact from the Order of the Velvet Glove, our band of merry misanthropes orchestrated a raid, which freed much of the slaves half by the Goblins in Givos.  Nisik slipped aside and found a watery basement filled with the goblins' food: leeches and other parasites, grown upon the semiconscious bodies of slaves.  He worked to disrupt the growing mechanism, and then fled with city with the others.  Irosk stayed behind to nurse his wounds and undertake Commerce Guild business.  Viktor, Nisik, and Rikku came ashore from the Givos at a small fishing village down the coast.  The backwards folk there were relatively hospitable and traded coin for lodging and horses, and after a nights' rest the group continued toward the ritual spot. After stumbling upon the savaged remains of travelers, they sought a night's refuge at a local Shrine to Lob, where a pair of acolytes seem to welcome their company, and gave them guidance on treating the blue rash that Viktor had acquired in Givos.  The next morning, after drugging and kidnapped a few pre-Barons from some traveling flagellants, they continued their journey down the Akklai Road.  The path, through drainage dug ravine, was littered with the remains of goblins, and the traps that took them down.  A few nigh-abandoned building were at the base of the hill, which had a small road leading along the inlet to the peak, where Nisik's calculations said the ritual should occur.  The path around the hill was edged by small boulders, each with one or more hunks of amberite embedded in them.  Facing the sea, they found a small cave which had been barred and locked.  In walls surrounded the cave mouth were small niches, many filled with shriveled, "preserved" eyeballs.  Upon breaking into the caves they found it deserted, once a mining locale.  Inside were the broken remains of wagons and barrels.  They slept through the night, and awoke to find themselves covered in dusty fingerprints.  They spoke to a local man and his son, who told them of the "Lamplighters" who came by the locale every few years to check on the cave, but knew little detail of their activities.    Tonight, the ritual.  S.|

Force Sensitive characters start with one additional Force Point, and from time to time may feel tremors in the Force.   Force Points All characters start game play with 1 force point. Characters who have the Force Sensitive merit gain an additional force point at the start of game and may have an unlimited number of force points as the game progresses. Characters without the Force Sensitive feat may only have 5 force points at any one time, any points awarded over and above this are lost.

1098|1098|2004-12-10 11:17:43|Nathaniel Bennett|[Star Wars] Vehicle Combat|I've got some stats for ground vehicles. Handling is the number of dice the pilot gets to add to his Manuever dice pool. Speed is the max safe speed in MPH. In a chase a vehicle with higher speed then its opponent gets to add two dice to the manuever pool when making maneuvers (but not in crash tests). Durability is the damage a vehicle can absorb before it takes structure damage. Structure is the total damage a vehicle can take before its destroyed. A vehicles handling is reduced by one die for ever structure damage it takes over its durability rating.   I've made record sheets which spell it all out.  Vehicle: Gravtruck Handling: 0 Speed: 80 Durability: 3 Structure: 18 			 Vehicle: Landspeeder Handling: 2 Speed: 120 Durability: 3 Structure: 15 			 Vehicle: Imperial Speeder Bike Handling: 4 Speed: 160 Durability: 2 Structure: 9 			 Vehicle: Swoop Handling: 5 Speed: 220 Durability: 2 Structure: 9    		 __________________________________  Do you Yahoo!?

As I starting putting my notes into playable fashion, I'm looking to get a list of items we need to address.  For those in a fog, when we last left the Knights of Plausible Deniability, they had found themselves in the middle of a Dream Realm coutryard, surrounded by hulking one-eyed, trunk-nose palace guards.  1. Rikuu?  What happened to him?  (I've got evil ideas of my own, but I'm open to others, when know to the characters or not) 2. Magic.  We should write out what we're using, and I know we can do better. 3. Basic rules.  Despite our weather and scheduling troubles, I think we have a better basic grasp of Storyteller now.  What have we been missing?  What doesn't feel right? 4. Character Advancement.  I'll pull out the sheets tonight or tomorrow, but we should look at character power levels, since we were doing a lot of ad hoc prior to now. 5. Others?|

Gaming Hut: Macro-orc-onomics  D&D is a game of entrepreneurial activity within a heavily regulated, price-fixed resource extraction industry. The dungeon is the oil field or nickel belt from which you and your fellow corporate executives extract your precious commodities.   You enjoy de facto exclusive rights to your gilded hole. Although other adventurers exist in your game as a matter of background detail, they rarely if ever impinge on your ability to mine your dungeon. (It�s too much work for the GM to run genuine competition for resources. She�d have to create a program to simulate the progress of NPC parties through her dungeon environment, with the availability of finite quantities of monsters and treasure decreasing over time.)  Monsters are not the competition; they are the resource. They have crude, sweet experience points inside them.  Prices are fixed, as if by a cartel. A gold piece is always a gold piece. A wand of cat�s grace is always worth 4,500 gp. Most crucially, the formulae for awarding the most precious resource of all, experience points, are static. They do not fluctuate according to the vagaries of supply and demand.  You spend xp to make capital expenditures, investing in technologies (feats, spells, additional levels) which will increase your productivity, allowing you to harvest more xp. As you adventure, you make operating expenditures, to keep your enterprise rolling. These are spell slots, doses of potion, and, most important of all, hit points you expend as you fight monsters, get burned by traps, and solve puzzles.  Your GM is the government. Her goal is to tax you as hard as she can without killing you � keeping your operating expenses high through taxes, tolls and fees: that is, effective monster tactics, traps, environmental hazards, time-consuming narrative complications, etc.     		 __________________________________  Do you Yahoo!?

Work and cute girls have prevented me on four occasions from finishing a decent synopsis of last week.  The "Knights" awoke on the bridge leading to Johud's palace (No sign of Rikku, Lum, or the Baron for that matter), surrounded by tusked and trunked massive Bykari guard.  They were escorted to meet Johud, the rule of the Dream Realm.  He remained hidden my an ivory screen and spoke through an interpreter of sorts.  They had a brief discussion, then were lead to luxurious quarters for the evening for rest and food.  In the morning, another brief discussion was held, but it had been obvious (through dream scrying) that the characters were not as knowledgeable of the Baron's ultimate plans.  They were then bound by oath and rib to Sijukiim, a prominent slaver, for a year (or until repaid), and escorted from the palace.  Experience Points: 8 given at the beginning of the session Drama Points: One to everyone (Didn't someone earn a second?)|

It differentiates a practitioner from a scholar.  The number of dots indictaes the practioner's potential, not prowess, but can be increased.  Merit: Magical Training - This merit represents training or skill in the practice of a particular magical art, such as Chlendi conjuration, tradition Maetah Precepts of Sorcery, or speculative alchemy.  The number of dots indictaes the practioner's  prowess and can be increased.  Skill: Incantations (previously listed as merits) - Spells and other effects that can performed instantaneously, or in a few minutes with little preparation (as opposed to rituals).  Incantations subject the caster to drain, though this can be mitigated by the use of fetishes and other material components.  Merit: Rituals - Indepth magical acts that take anywhere from minutes to days to perform.  Usually involve multiple practitioners, extensive material components, sacrifices, and a proper alignment of astrological or geological elements.  Rituals allow more extensive for powerful effects than incantations, with relatively limited drain upon the primary practioner.|

Thoughts?     Reading through Dying Earth one thing I like is that they have different styles of magic which give bonuses to different activites. Examples are stufious magic, devious magic, and forceful magic. I like the different styles and it makes me wonder what the deal is with Chlendi Sorcery. I can't quite pin down the basics of Chlendi Sorcery. It seems like we're trying to blend D&D style studious magic with a spirit based, coercion magic.  So it would be helpful to me if we stepped back a second and descused magic from a broader standpoint. What powers it, and what are the basics of Chlendi Sorcery?   		 __________________________________  Do you Yahoo!?  Yahoo!

1235|1235|2005-03-31 16:17:31|Nathaniel Bennett|More macro-orc-onomics|According to Macro-orc-onomic theory, the party cleric functions as the group's banker, who dishes up extra operating funds (hit points) as the rest of the team requires. I prefer to extend the metaphor in a way that keeps the party inside a single corporate entity. So personally I'd compare the cleric to the investor relations guy who raises emergency cash from venture capitalists.   What I can tell you for sure is who the party thief really is.   Traps are an exercise in taxation. DMs use them to increase the hit point cost of dungeon travel and treasure extraction. Rogues employ their professional skills to decrease the number and severity of taxation events.   They are therefore the tax lawyers of D&D.   http://www.livejournal.com/users/robin_d_laws/   		 __________________________________  Yahoo! Messenger  Show us what our next emoticon should look like.

1236|1232|2005-04-01 12:36:54|widderslainte|Re: [Magic] Making Intelligence Worthwhile|> I can't quite pin down the basics of Chlendi Sorcery. It seems  > like we're trying to blend D&D style studious magic with a  > spirit based, coercion magic.   We have been from the start.  The magic that the Chlendi use isn't Sorcery in the traditional sense.  They practice the summoning and binding of spirits, divination through those spirits and astrology, as well as some herbalism and aspects of Shamanism. That is the cultural core of what they Chlendi specialize.  Anything else would represent some study of different forms or the syncretistic vomit that is D&D.  Theoretically anyone can learn the arts of the Chlendi.  It doesn't take any special birthright or in-born "gift", though they would tell you differently.  You learn the correspondences, the hierarchies of spirits, and how to use the various tools in the rituals (in the loosest sense of the term 'ritual').  The Chlendi differentiate spirits of this world (the milieu - includes spirits of nature and structure within this plane) from the aetheric (those beyond this plane).  The conjunction of stars and other heavenly bodies with the veins and deposits of amberite in Uod is the key to summoning aetheric spirits.  Unlike the Mindat, there is no internal force to be harnessed.  Unlike traditional Sorcery of the Maetah, there is not a collection of energy-bearing trinkets that need to be combined with words and gestures. It is knowledge and the force of will.  *That* is why the Chlendi look down on other "scientists" and works of magic.  S.|

Sounds as good as any other Storyteller mechanic.   > Then we'd just need to > hammer out the basics of what Force X spirits can do,   In SR terms, each spirit has a statline based on it's Force  (Strength = Force +2, for example).  It terms of function  capabilities, look at the list of "services" I posted earlier.   I think that should give enough flexibility, with out finding  some window dressing explanation for each and every D&D spell.  This may give Nisik cause to study some non-Chlendi forms of  sorcery, which I don't see as a bad thing.   > and some more Chlendi term then "force" to describe > spirit power levels.   I've got a few descriptive terms jotted down somewhere  from my never-finished extra-planar layout.  May not be  granular enough for a one-to-one correspondence, but  should be good.|

The only problem i see with this use is that Nisik would incur drain in summoning the creature who would then assist in lowering drain on a spell?  I guess there could be situations for that if there was some large ritual or something but it seems odd to me.  BTW you had asked about Nisik's spells:   Nisik's 'spells' are currently listed as (using D&D names): Sleep, Mage Armor, Invisibility, Web.

It would be common to call a spirit to watch over you/the perimeter while sleeping, traveling, or studying.  In a more concrete sense, it could be an air elemental to create a wall of swirling winds in front of you, or a spirit that mimics your moves to blow incoming blows.  The general idea is to call a spirit to you, and tell it what to do, or just stick around, rather than cast a normal D&D spell and find some way to explain how the spirits did it.  In the case of bolts of flame, you would instead conjure a fire elemental (as an easy example), who would attack your foes, while you sit back and have some tea.   > The only problem i see with this use is that Nisik would incur drain > in summoning the creature who would then assist in lowering drain on a > spell?

Approach the enemy locale, and blow a huge spell, something that would normally knock you out or cause physical backlash.  Instead, the spirit takes the brunt of the drain as it's service to you an disperses.   > Nisik's 'spells' are currently listed as (using D&D names): Sleep, > Mage Armor, Invisibility, Web.

Sitting back and having some tea sounds nice.  Nisik would like that. Perhaps other spirit to cook the tea...        >> The only problem i see with this use is that Nisik would incur     >> drain in summoning the creature who would then assist in     >> lowering drain on a spell?

1277|1277|2005-04-21 11:24:32|widderslainte|Tonight! (And summary)|We're on.    After meeting, and being dismissed by Johud (the master of the Dream Realm), they are sold into slavery to a local workmaster.  As their first task the group ventured out in the wilds and fields outside The City Beyond The River, with their new master Sijukiim. Ambushed by wild Bykari, the collected themselves and tracked down Sabah, a former toady of the Baron that had fled the scene. Roaming through the high grasses, they laughed and joked crushing small spiderkin, even being amazed at Irosk's martial skills. Then they found the lair of the mother.  And the remains of Sijukiim, who had been dragged off by the mother.  They reassemble the wagon (and themselves) and raced back to the city hoping to avoid more assaults by the massive tusked beasts.    - Will they manage to annul their contract of slavery? - Will they find their way home? - Will we ever come up with a satisfactory rule set?  Stay tuned!  S.|

1290|1290|2005-04-27 16:27:38|shawnbarrick|Conjuring, again|Here's what I had before.  Notes at the bottom:  1. Each spirit has a Force, which indicates it's power (As a general descriptor. A Force 4 Spirit is like saving a Level 7 Fighter). The force determines the strength and abilities of the spirit, as well as the difficulty to summon and control.  2. The sorceror roles his casting power. Each success indicated one "service" the spirit owes the summoner before he departs.  3. The drain is based on the force of the spirit.  This is ripped right out of Shadowrun. The problem is ST uses fixed difficulties, where in Shadowrun, the tartget number when you roll your casting pool is determined by the strength of the spirit. That's something we'll have to figure out.  Straight from SR:  - Aid Sorcery (boost casting pool or absorb drain) - Aid Study - Physical service (move earth, break down gate) - Sustain Spell - Remote Service (surveillence) - Attack - Protection - Divination (my addition)  ----------------  My suggestion is a change on the drain procedure, at least for conjuring.  Before we did (Drain Dice - Resolve), and each success was a non-lethal level.  NEW IDEA:  Drain = the Force (Ftagn level) of the  spirit, *reduced* by successes rolled on resolve.  In last night's case.  Ftagn 4 Spirit = 4 levels of non-lethal.  Soaked by success on a Resolve roll.  Perhaps allowing dice from the casting pool to be withheld.|

1390|1390|2005-07-26 11:03:58|widderslainte|Review and Such|We're on for tonight.  I'll get the A/C cranking for an hour or two prior to everyone's arrival.  -------------------- Recent events:  The airship was re-"fueled" and haphazardly sailed back to the City Beyond the River, where it was left with Voloy and his crew.  They provided some sustenance and locomotion back to the city. The coordinates and offerings of blood were made, and the group returned to Uod in a wholly undramatic sequence.  They awoke in a wagon outside Cuvauw, under the care of Dr. Mupheus Thoad and Lum.  Rikuu and Lum had taken the pre-corpses back to Cuvauw after the ritual near Akklai Point.  A few months had passed, and the group returned to Cuvauw to see what had transpired in their absence:  - The Goblins have slowly moved further north.  Rikku has "raised a horde" or some semblance to assist in the resistance. - Elle has closed the Manorhouse and moved south with a young man.  His description sounds eerily familiar. - The fights are going well at the Asylum, though Rikuu absconded with much of the profits to fund his horde.  Vanos presented you with a small bag of coins that he's tucked away.  Following the man to a house near the slums, the windows shatter and blow out.  The group rushed upstairs to find the remains of a shabby month-long stakeout: four bedrolls, some clothing and personal effects.  Among the items was a notebook {see below) and a scarab-like broach.  In the back of the townhouse, a room covered in silky, spider-like webbing and four open cocoons (one very recent).  "The Master bid us South, past Givos, to Akklai Point. The cletches has lost the scent somewhere in route." [Hides the worst of the winter amidst Akklai Point, then describes a routine journey west, and upriver to Imphomonee.]  "The locals call the winter here mild. I shudder to think of what my brother is finding in the hills, tracking that damn Heteri. We've been here for three weeks, scouting. Nothing. No hatchings, no visions. Not a damn thing to report. [Two months of bland entries about the weather, root vegetables, and the quality of local whores - raving about Yita's Palace of Flesh] Lamplighters making rounds at the usual locations, bathing at the spring, and surveilling nogs. Nogs for Mustyoch's Love! Nogs. Time to go down to the bar, cringe at the lot of idols and drink away a poor man's sorrows."|

The report from Friday is that they had turned off the AC and the place was packed to the rafters, making for a very uncomfortable experience. Also they stopped stocking the bar so the only drinks left were the less popular ones.  Saturday the line was 6 abreast and around the block in both directions so my friends who showed up at 11 didn't think they'd get in before closing and bailed.  ManRay is dead.

1418|1418|2005-08-21 22:01:15|widderslainte|Updates, Planning, Various & Sundry|Item the first: We should be on for Tuesday.  After this (I believe), Mark is ditching  us for a couple weeks.  There was talk of an interim game as well as a  boozing adventure.  Thoughts?  Item the second: I've been cracking away on Imphomonee.  I'm sure in typical Uod fashion,  we'll managed to avoid any of the areas I've detailed.  Don't feel  obliged to have the characters stick around there.  Item the third: The wordpress site (http://www.daimones.net/wordpress) looks nice, and  is damned easy to compose in, but it's not good for organizing my  thoughts.  I'm playing around with some other wiki type tools.  I'm gone  next weekend, but some time around Labor Day I'll send out the link to  the nogopedia, which should be a better reference for Uod.  Item the fourth: Uod needs a logo.  I'm thinking about something akin to a white worm  style oroborus, with something (a nig head, crossed pistols, a gaint  "U") in the center.  Suggestions? Variations?  Snide remarks about what  else Uod needs?  S.|

I'm digging through my notes (this weekend, not Friday night).  Think of hedge wizards and a bit of natural magic.  Alteration and  Enchantment in the d20 world.  It deals with the real world (not  spirits) and real things, or the properties thereof.  Maetah (or "Traditional" Sorcery) is big on fetish and icons (material  components), especially as a way of dealing with drain.  A nice cookie-cutter spell, though a bit mundane, would be something  like "Blood Blessing of Musthyoch" - a temporary enchantment for edged  weapons.  S.|

1505|1502|2005-11-07 20:02:29|Mark Simpson|Re: uod - meatah magic spells|So i gave it a little thought and here are two sketches of spells. I'll have to think of better names though...  1. Lob's Stamina: gives the recipient extra 'health' per success.    However at the end of the duration, this extra health is removed    and all the damage is taken by the person themselves.  This is like    the boar who can keep fighting longer than they should be able to    given their wounds and then suddenly give out and die.     In Storyteller terms the health is added on the 'left' side and any    existing damage is transfered there, then when the duration is up    the extra health is removed and it is all pushed 'right' bruise    upgrading to lethal upgrading to aggravated... thus the person    might be feeling fine and then suddenly die when the duration is    up.  2. Uzhidohmi's Bedazzling Stars (a.k.a My God, it's full of stars)        The target is enchanted to see and be bedazzled by a myriad    blinking lights/stars.  This effectively keeps them from defending    themselves.     In Storyteller terms they lose their defense.  In both cases need to determine an attribute to link them to and some duration mechanism.  The second one seemed better when it popped into my mind, but now i am disappointed with it [sigh].  BTW: Did this tome of arcane secret's bestow a dot in Maetah Sorcery to Nisik as well as the knowledge of these spells?  If not i'll spend some xp for a dot or two.|

Maybe a dragon (reptile for Nisik) with red talons (red bridle for Irosk)? Not sure what color the dragon or background would be...anyone have suggestions about the new baron's heraldry?  Also I was thinking that maybe we should rethink our stance on Thedine. I'm a little fuzzy at this point about why we're at odds with the church and if its because of the actions of one priest maybe we can deal with him and make nice with the church itself. I don't know much about the faith of Thedine, maybe they would make good allies in the coming war with Johud?  I'll check the wiki and see if there's anything there about Thedine.  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

1588|1587|2005-12-16 14:57:14|Nathaniel Bennett|Re: Harlots table|And a text version:  Harlot encounters can be with brazen strumpets or haughty courtesans, thus making it difficult for the party to distinguish each encounter for what it is. (In fact, the encounter could be with a dancer only prostituting herself as it pleases her, an elderly madam, or even a pimp.) In addition to the offering of the usual fare, the harlot is 30% likely to know valuable information, 15% likely to make something up in order to gain a reward, and 20% likely to be, or work with, a thief. You may find it useful to use the sub-table below to see which sort of harlot encounter takes place:  01-10 Slovenly trull  11-25 Brazen strumpet  26-35 Cheap trollop 36-50 Typical streetwalker 51 -65 Saucy tart  66-75 Wanton wench  76-85 Expensive doxy 86-90 Haughty courtesan 91-92 Aged madam 93-94 Wealthy procuress 95-98 Sly pimp 99-00 Rich panderer  An expensive doxy will resemble a gentlewoman, a haughty courtesan a noblewoman, the other harlots might be mistaken for goodwives, and so forth.   --- Nathaniel Bennett <nathaniel_bennett@yahoo.com> wrote:   > By request, here's the Harlots table from the 1st > Edition DMG. >  > __________________________________________________ > Do You Yahoo!? > Tired of spam?

If people still have interest in The Museum we could do some character revamping/switching and dive back in. If people feel their DnD itch has been scratched for now then we can get together and put together some details about Gunnison and your characters for the new game.

1744|853|2006-03-20 09:07:54|Nathaniel Bennett|Tomorrow night|Let me know if you're not good for tomorrow night. What I'd like to do tomorrow is finish off characters, pick a final Aspect for Gunnison, talk about the story arcs in the game, and hopefully play a little foraging mission scenario to let you get into character a little and see the system in action. This would be a Prologue, with next week being Episode 1.  Dave's character is ex-Army and he's been working for the ranching commune managing their labor forces (human and robotic). He's capable and friendly, and when the shit hit the fan he stepped up and helped organize teams to go out and gather resources from the surrounding areas. So I'm thinking the common thread for the characters could be that you all volunteered to be on one of these resource reclaimation teams.   As for the fifth Aspect of Gunnison Dave was most interested in Denial over Survival or Factionalised. He thought that would create the most interesting internal conflicts and lots of speed bumps for your characters. Anyone have any new ideas about the last Aspect?  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

1766|1766|2006-04-04 09:47:55|Nathaniel Bennett|Homework assignment #3: Advancement Goals|Your homework for the next session is to come up with a Goal and the way you think you'll spend your next skill point.  The Goal is the next Aspect your character is working towards. You're free to change your mind, especially if something happens in game that inspires your ideas about character advancement. For example a possible Goal I see from play would be "Salvage Expert" or "Regulator Captain". It'll be more difficult to see future advancement at this early part in the game, but as we hit critical story mass it should become easier.  I'd like to give skill points out about once every other session or so, which should cover an "episode". As with your character Goal feel free to change it up, but if we know before hand what your characters are working towards we can make that part of the game. For example if Top Gun is teaching some of you to ride, you could say you plan to put your next skill point into Ride.   After spending your fourth skill point you get to add a new Aspect and Stunt.

The skills will be public speaking, persuasion, religion (and probably others since i need to keep the 'pyramid').  After the prologue i used the skill point awarded for Public Speaking.  Let me know if you need more details.  p.s. unfortunately i haven't been able to sit down to make a 'speech' for Daniel for the next game.  Nor do i think i'll have the time.  But i have general gist and perhaps some specific turns of phrase.  The rest we'll need to handle with skill checks i guess.|

Its an Excel spreadsheet and for most areas you just type in the text. However the Skills section will tabulate how many skills you have at each ladder level if put something in each skill level cell for the skills you have and leave the rest blank. I've got a wingdings character for a black box in the sample, so feel free to use that or find something else (an 'X' will do). Be sure to put a character in each level of the skill, not just the current level. Its much easier to show this then to explain it...

1784|1782|2006-04-12 11:40:45|Nathaniel Bennett|Re: Game tonight!|> Does this need to be a new skill?   No. The way advancement works is that every few sessions I'll give you a skill point which you spend like you did during character creation. Every 4 skill points gets you a new Aspect and stunt.

So going from Unskilled to Fair/+1 costs one skill point. Going from Fair/+1 to Good/+2 costs one point.  The Teaching skill will have an impact on the game. That's one of the reasons I want to know what skills the characters are working to develop. If you've got a teacher you'll be able to advance more quickly. Also Teaching will allow people to learn highly technical skills which you wouldn't be able to self-teach (like Medicine, Engineering, Science, etc.).  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

1787|1787|2006-04-12 14:22:46|Nathaniel Bennett|Aftermath/Setting: Youth Scouts of America|Several of the PCs have backgrounds involving the Youth Scouts of America, so I thought I'd provide some background info, which can also be found on the Wiki at http://aftermath.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_in_the_Aftermath.  Youth Scouts of America  Formed in the early teens the Youth Scouts of America combined both the Boy and Girl Scouts of America into one gender-neutral, non-denominational organization. The mission of the YSA is to:      * Offer young people responsible fun and adventure;     * Train young people in citizenship, service, and leadership;     * Serve America's communities and families.   Since its inception the YSA has had a close relationship with various government agencies including the military, Interior Department and Forestry service. The relationship between the YSA and US Armed Forces has been the cause of some criticism, and recent recruitment statistics has led some to claim the YSA is feeder for the military.  The YSA maintains the scouting traditions of ranks and skill awards, and a focus on camping and outdoor activities. However the YSA also provides exposure to modern pursuits and technology and helps prepare America's youth for the challenges of the 21st centruy. Several high profile sports and media stars have been members of the YSA and continue to provide financial and media support for the organization.   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

1788|1788|2006-04-14 10:18:13|Nathaniel Bennett|Homework Assignment #4: Distinctive Items and Hat|Your homework assignment for next session is a two parter. Part I is to come up with your character's Distinctive Items. What does your character wear or carry that would definitely have to be on his action figure? I'm talking Indiana Jones' hat and whip, Magnum PI's Hawaiian shirt and Detroit Tigers hat, or Wolverine's cigar and sideburns. Extra credit if you come up with backstory about why the gear is meaningful to your character.   Example: Rance Allen has long, dirty blonde hair he pulls back in a tight pony tail. He wears a suede jacket with tassles. Like this one: http://www.blair.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=23963  Part II is to decide on a signature hat. In the winter in Colorado people wear hats. Especially if they're out foraging the war stricken countryside. Cowboy hats are popular, as are skiing hats. Describe the style, color, and any emblems/sports teams logos/company logos it bears, how you got it and if its just practical or has some emotional value.  Example: Vern "Bouncer" White is fond of his well-worn black straw cowboy hat with snakeskin band.  Completing the homework is worth 1 FP at the start of next session.  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

The recent True 20 incarnation has a "class feat" (for lack of a simpler  phrase) that is activated by "action point" use.  For example, the  Warrior gets to erase all minor wounds.

Personally I enjoyed the hell out of last night's game and felt that the energy level was much better then the previous week. Was last night too heavy on the exposition and didn't get everyone involved enough? I thouht the flow of the session went well, with a big dramatic turn at the end.   What do you want more of? Dial up the sci-fi? Dial up the threat of violence?  What do you want less of? Dial down the Denial? Dial down the politics?  Hopefully you can see that your characters are starting to have success in changing the complextion of Gunnison and that reality is starting to dawn on some of the Ostriches.  The Furture is up to you. Step up and lead or step back and follow...  *evil GM laugh and mustach twirl*  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

I > thouht the flow of the session went well, with a big > dramatic turn at the end.    I thought the level of exposition was fine.  On a practical level, we had plenty of reason to work together as a scavenger team. As  cops, I don't know.  I'm happy to hand wave it and say we're buddies in  the interest of the campaign, but we should at least make it clear.  Knowing last nights events were pertinent to us "as a team" would have  ramped up Mitch's interest a bit.  Right now, he's a reactive character, which was part of the charm of his  concept. I either need to change him a little or change his relationship  to the group.   > What do you want more of? Dial up the sci-fi? Dial up > the threat of violence?   I would say both, out of personal preference.  I don't know that we need more sci-fi, but I wouldn't say that it feels like 50 years in the future.  Part of the that is the post-war collapse, though, so a lot of the technological changes are out of the pictures.  But we might as well be playing in 2003 as far as it appears.   > What do you want less of? Dial down the Denial? Dial > down the politics?   I don't mind the politics.  But at the onset it sounded like more of a survival game, so I've got survival skills that have limited use at cookouts.  --  ------------------------- widderslainte@comcast.net|

After the dissolution of the Heteri  Kings, and the unifying violence of the Chlendi Empire, Eskla and  Chlendi nobles took control of the town, ruling by the grace and proxy  of the Empire.  As the largest port in the Rhiat, most goods went sent  up river through Vennosat City to the core of the Empire.  When the  Mindat Wars shifted the the eastern front, the Emperor's council placed  immense tariffs and taxes on shipping and trade flowing though the city  to fund the effort.  With the backing of the the Shn-Kvaruth, and the  sabotage of Mindat cells, the noble houses pooled their might and  declared independence in 2679.  Now burdened the infrastructure of a new nation, and lacking the order  and numbers of a military, Vennosat City became an immense "frontier  town" as merchants and less savory traders took advantage of new found  out economic possibilities.  Any guilds without noble ties to the new  regime were shut off the market rush, and fought their way back in to  trade among peasants. The wharf district was overrun with slave trade,  as much of the indentured labor was dragged north when the Empire pulled  out.  Noble houses, now the rulers of a nation, were content to profit  and hide behind the walls of the manorhouses.  They took over the royal  enclave in the western hill, and walled the district off to forestall  the rapidly encroaching wharf distract, and it's accompanying filth and  disease.  Other noble families took residence in the burgeoning city of  Noduan on the southern coast.  As long as the profits were strong, the  nobles were content, and underseers began bargaining with underworld  gangs and guild influences to make their cut on the side.  These deals  spawned modern crime syndicates such as the Viceers and the Blacktongues.  But everyone from Vensat knew that if profits were at stake it could not  last.  After his head accountant and his family were slaughtered, Venras  Ducat, newly "crowned" head of the city oligarchy, took action.  A  veteran of border conflicts with Balancont, he brought violence to bear,  hiring an entire troupe of Heteri mercenaries as his private army with  the city.  They swept through the wharf district, cutting down or  shackling able bodied men, and razing buildings to the ground.  Faced  with a labour shortage and loss of merchandise, the guild had little  option than to strike a deal with the noble houses. --  ------------------------- widderslainte@comcast.net|

Cthulhu was invented by novelist H.P. Lovecraft and was said to be sleeping beneath the Pacific Ocean.

I'll be out of town for a couple days at some point before the  end of the month, but I may be able to plan around a tentative session.  Here are the rough options in my mind:  * Continue Aftermath * Uod, all new characters * Uod, some new characters * Uod, same old punks * Shawn runs something else * Tom runs something else * Mark runs something else  I've got a ideas for a few other games I'd like to run, but at a certain  point, I'd prefer to through the prep work into Uod.  But I do have a  few thoughts of a few "quick and dirty" month long games I could run.  S. --  ------------------------- widderslainte@comcast.net|

However it would be cool if we had some time to sit down and talk about where we want Aftermath to go. Character development, Gunnison development, plotlines, etc. We could take the week of the 21st to hammer out those details.  Another possibility would be to play a complex boardgame for a few weeks. I love big, fancy board games, though I'd understand if other people don't find them to be fun. I'm talking Axis and Allies type games that would take us a couple of weeks to finish, not a game like Settlers which we can finish in a single night. I've got a few candidates in mind if there's interest in playing.  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

I'll leave those considerations to people more familiar with the games in question.   >> Perhaps I should have said "3-4 session games".  I >> think we're all  >> accustomed to scheduling woes at this point. >  > Yeah, what he said!   As I've mentioned to Nathaniel, I've got ideas for Underdark, Pirates  and Sci-Fi campaigns, but all would more prep time than doing Uod (which  is my preference for a longer game).  I think the trick for an "interim  game" would be something that doesn't require a lot of setting and  system explanation, and where we can through the characters right into a  story and get some reasonable conclusion.  To completely ignore my prior statement, we *could* do a Shadowrun,  which is a much more streamlined system (like World of Darkness but with  d10s).  Build characters and run through a mission or two.  We could  also try something like Burning Wheel, which is designed to be  Tolkein-ish fantasy.  We'd spend a little more time learning the system,  and then take some stock characters through a brief adventure to see how  cool the system is.

Assuming we stick with storyteller in the next Uod story arc, I think we'll give this a shot.  A few tweaks to work better with the setting, and address the fact that not every character is a sorcerer.  The "defining merit" is what makes you a sorceror.  What that merit is defines the difference between your style of magic from all the others. A Mindat theurge will have a different defining merit than Nisik what. The only (mechanical) requisite is having an Occult skill of 1, and then  acquiring a Defining Merit at a score of 4.  I've posted up the list of  standard defining merits from the book, and the subsequent path merits  for your perusal.  S.  --  ------------------------- widderslainte@comcast.net|

Something akin to that.  It's more of a structure for powers than a  definition of individual powers themselves.  I'm dying for a PDF of  Second Sight.  But, yes, I would consider "The Arts of the South" to be a defining  merit, with it's own set of set of Path Merits.  The universal merits  (Countermagic, Warding, etc) wouldn't really apply.  s. --  ------------------------- widderslainte@comcast.net|

2594|2594|2008-11-17 15:14:09|widderslainte|A hundred thousand years|A hundred thousand years before Columbus or Cook, the Lemurian Empire stretched from their sunken homeland between Asia and Australia north to the Himalayas, south to Tasmania and New Zealand, and east to the Rocky Mountains. They ruled the world when another race - the half-vegetable things of Algol's second planet - descended to earth, and fought a war with bows and spears against star-crossing technology - and had partial success. The Algolians' technology, a weird hybrid of DNA and silicon, decayed on Earth, and the ancient race had forgotten the potential of even primitive technology when backed by the spirit and courage of a still-young species. The decaying race was forced into the deserts of Australia, scene of the war's most devastating conflicts.  There, the mightiest Algolian weapons had been used - corruptors of the Earth. Many of their bio-weapons had the side-effect of mutating the local fauna to be more deadly; this can be seen in the region even to this day. The changing Algolian biotechnology, its mutation speeded by the radiation from several nuclear strikes, produced vast monsters - towers of bone, flesh, wood, leaf, and venom. These creatures devoured the Algolians, their unwitting creators, eliminating them wholly from the earth.  The monsters then raged across the lands of Earth, forming a far direr threat to the Lemurians than the Algolian War itself. In the terrible conflict, the monsters were destroyed, but the Lemurian Empire was so damaged that it decayed to stone-age levels and vanished in a few centuries.  Though the first generation was destroyed, monsters still breed from all the sites of Algolian warfare - Australia primarily, but also areas scattered throughout Eurasia and the Pacific Rim. It is these monsters that were slain by all the heroes of legend. If the world is free of monsters for a long time - five centuries or a millennium - they will be all the more terrible they will be when they at last re-appear. And the last monsters were slain fifteen centuries ago.|

At one time a thousand or more runes, spells, incantations, curses, and sorceries had been known. The reach of Grand Motholam--Ascolais, the Ide of Kauchique, Almery to the South, the Land of the Falling Wall to the East--swarmed with sorcerers of every description, of whom the chief was the Arch-Necromancer Phandaal. A hundred spells Phandaal personally had formulated--though rumor said that demons whispered at gus ear when he wrought magic. Pontecilla the Pious, then ruler of Grand Motholam, put Phandall to torment, and after a terrible night, he killed Phandaal and outlawed sorcery throughout the land. The wizards of Grand Motholam fled like beetles under a strong light; the lore was dispersed and forgotten, until now, at this dim time, with the sun dark, wilderness obscuring Ascolais, and the white city Kaiin half in ruins, only a few more than a hundred spells remained to the knowledge of man. Of these, Mazirian had access to seventy-three, and gradually, by stratagem and negotiation, was securing the others.      Maziriam made a selection from his books and with great effort forced five spells upon his brain: Phandaal's Gyrator, Felojun's Second Hypnotic Spell, The Excellent Prismatic Spray, The Charm of Untiring Nourishment, and the Spell of the Omnipotent Sphere. This accomplished, Maziriam drank wine and retired to his couch.|

It is not used to write love notes to succubi or scribe monographs, even to the most esteemed circles of sorcerous academia.  The shaft of the pen should be made of ash or hazel, cut while both moons are visible in the sky.  Some say the feather should be plucked from a pregnant crow, but true sorcerers know this is a blind.  The feather is purely ornamental, but the nib must be of bronze.  The whole item, once complete, should be consecrated in rat's blood with an invocation of Hielil, Chlendi Spirit of the Word.|

To this day, Ivogd's Clan of the Studded Reign controls the vast salt mines, now the leading export of Jakinta (just ahead of white steel).  |

Qod Infaux were the leading astrologers and advisers to the ruling Clan of the Lily Crown in Asklor and held sway in the councils of Imphomonee and Minkaraph decades ago.  Members of the clan still hold high rank in both the Jewelers' and Clayworkers' guildhalls in the valley.  When the dread events at Minkaraph broke the spine of the Chlendi Empire and Balancont fell under the sway of the Goblin Queen, the clan's economic support collapsed.  To maintain their holdings and any semblance of their status, the Clan brokered deals with its "lessers", acquiesced on trade disputes, and committed their progeny to questionable contracts.  The Infaux concentrated their remaining wealth and resources in a massive clan hall in Vennosat City, full of scrolls and tomes, and began funneling their meager income into support an allied sorcerer's lodge, The Lelleivantli.  Together, they have begun purchasing land in ancestral Chlendi areas among the swamps of Ramush and stockpiling amberite from the few extant mines.  The Lelleivantli are know as the foremost academics on Chlendi summoning techniques and dedicated recorders of population migrations along the northern seacoast. Donkad Infaux himself, the elder of Clan Infaux, has been seen in the village of Pugshlow buying up old fisheries and ruins for use by lodge he know tutors under.|

If one walks upstream for a mile, you can see the river suddenly change from a virulent green to the normal muddy brown of the Minkush waters.  Various scholars attribute the green colour to the swamp vegetation or mountain ores from the river's source, but few are satisfied with an explanation of why the colour disappears so suddenly.  At that spot, the earth is dead and salted - no plants grow, and no animal approach the waters to drink.  A sect of monks, learned in the Chlendi traditions of sorcery and shamanism, have devoted their existence to prayers and chants at this spot, all to placate the Nuxad, a flock of river spirits known throughout the northwest.  Unlike most areas, here the Nuxad are not peaceful and wise.  For centuries that have lashed out at passing travelers, boats, and the more innocent of deer, dragging them all to a watery death in retribution for long forgotten wrongs done years ago.

Ever since, the Chlendi have kept a keen eye for the sign of oracles. Female descendants of the original oracle, Laxotli, are kept in isolation, bred according to complex lineage charts in hopes they will bear the next bringer of truth.  It is said the oracles speak with spirits will still and the womb and learn the arts of prescience, thus not needing the arts of Chlendi sorcery.  Those born with six fingers are said to the mark of augury, and are denied their mother's milk. By stunting the physical growth, the oracle shall focus his vision.  When the amberite mines of Asklor went dead, the Laxotli knew.  When the city-now-called-Minkaraph fell to the Mindat, the few Laxotli resident had fled weeks before.  Now they flock to the towns of Pugshlow and Imphomonee, looking for those born with extra teeth.|

Scant months later, the Emperor Guad, his family, the artisan and most of the court will slaughtered in a coup, and the palace sacked.  The idols were presumed lost or destroyed until one, that of the Guad infant son, appeared in a trove hauled from a shipwreck off the coast of Givos.  It was passed on to the Preceptor of the Rais-Worm Lodge in Bolog, who purchased it from a gambler unaware of its significance. Study showed that the wood used in the idol was taken from a Sh'n soul tree, probably taken during the artisan's work as a shipwright during Mindat invasion of the Sh'n homeland.  The carving depicts the infant lying on his side, huddled around a lit lantern.  The Preceptor claims he has not aged a day since taking possession of the idol, and his hair and nails remain the same length, even restored each morning after a cutting.  Curious about effects of the other idols, member of his Lodge will pay dearly for any information of their whereabouts.|

It is the central religious text of the Mindat and has never been adequately translated out of the Mindat language, and while quoted frequently, is never read aloud. It describes a process and trails of harnessing one's soul, which is called "walking the labyrinth". The book itself is bound in white leather and is upwards of 400 pages. Many of the pages, or parts of the pages are left blank to be filled in by the adherent recording his progress or completing exercises. Other religious movements are officially banned in Mindat, but in practice are tolerated as long they refrain from public displays or other forms of social upheaval.

But as a budding sorcerer, he was quickly found to be lacking the willpower to command certain orders of Chlendi spirits and instead devoted himself to more scholarly pursuits.  He spent the majority of his adult life travelling throughout the Rhiat, taking notes and collect true names from other dweomercrafters, whether they were Heteri shamans, Mindat theurges, or the local herbalist from a pocket community of Chlendi.  Viljimil was well into middle age when he finally returned to Asklor to compose the text itself.  He enlisted a team of nog servants to attend to his needs, organize texts and keep him supplied.  As a result, scholar today argue whether the taxonomical decisions on Heteri beast forms were Viljimil's actual intent, or is pages were taken by his chef to wrap provisions.  Viljimil himself is said to have lost his grasp on reality towards the end, haphazardly calling down spirits for clarification, company, and energy to keep writing. Given his lack of skill at abjuration itself, few were surprised when his emaciated husk was found sprawled out over the completed text, quill still in hand, but missing both eyes.  Copies of The Hierarchy are rare, but can be found amongst one or two lodges in most major cities.  The tome itself is massive, contained folklore, charts, and drawings in additional the encyclopedia and taxonomy of spirits itself.  Though not known if simple ethnocentrism or respect for the author is at cause, but Viljimil's Hierarchy can only be found written in Chlendi.|

The magnificent construction won him the favour of the girl and her whole family, and soon Favod the Younger was the famous artist of the city.

Often mistaken (or coinciding!) for rumoured cults of true ghuls that lurk beneath the oldest cities the the Rhiat.  The Becoming: There are two doors to the Way of the Flesh: being born again and communion. Those that are born again are termed the anpiscis. The rebirth is the process of death. When one dies from ghuls feeding, it is likely they will be born again. It is a painful and traumatic process. It is never desired by the victim, and rarely intended by the Ghul. The process takes seven days after the victims death, the victim becomes cognizent, but can not act, move, or speak. Thus the new anpiscis will often awaken in a morgue, during funerary preparation, or during the funeral. The most traumatic can be when the awakening comes after the burial. Many anpisci lose their sanity from the awakening and claw or chew themselves to oblivion, even before their second life begins. The path of communion is less traumatic, but more depraved. It is the creation of true ghouls, or their proper term ghul. It results from a steady, continuous diet on solely human flesh and blood. Many of the grotesque and repellant characterisitics of the ghul occur from frequent flesh consumption, as in the case of cannibals and deranged serial killers.  Why flesh and blood? It is traditional, and written in the holy books, that flesh and blood are essential to eternal life. But the flesh must be infused with prana or the omnessence of the empyreal realm, which is what sustains the body for eternity. For this same, reason, spiritual people and mystics are preferred food sources.  The hermetic ideas of correspondence apply to the Ghul. Effects are obtained through consumptia the act of eating particular body parts. The eyes bring memories, the brain knowledge, the muscles and sinews strength and resistence, the genetalia passion and virility.|

2635|2635|2009-06-11 15:15:52|widderslainte|Magic Mechanics Example|Here's an appropriate spell I stole from a Reign supplement.  This particular incantation would probably be found in Traditional Sorcery (Precept of Milieu) and Witchcraft:  Nyctopian Vision Intensity: 2 Casting Time: Instant Duration: Width in Minutes Attunement: No Effect: While this spell is in effect, the caster can use his Eerie sense instead of Sight for the purposes of looking into dark places. Note that this does not work for looking at illuminated sights, even if the sorcerer is blind.  How does this work?  First you roll your dice pool, using the appropriate magic skill (such as Traditional Sorcery) + your score in the sense attribute.  This is ORE, so you're looking for matches in the numbers rolled.  Because the spell has intensity 2, you need the matched dice to be 2+ (a pair of one's won't do it).  The width, which determines the duration of the spell is how many dice match.  Did you roll three 7's (3x7 in ORE nomenclature)?  The spell lasts 3 minutes. "Attunement: No" means you do not need a pact or ritual dedication tying you to this style of magic.  Attunement is more common in higher forms of Chlendi sorcery, where you invoke the spirits directly into your body, or Mindat Theurgy, where you seek to perfect your higher consciousness.  A proper Mindat attunement may open the third eye, which is necessary for the finding your way through the labyrinth of one's soul.  What the Reign Magic mechanics lack is a drain/backlash mechanic.  I suspect I'd implement something like an opposed roll between the height of the roll or intensity of the spell versus the caster's Command+Vigor.  That's not done all in one roll, so it may require further thought.  Perhaps Waste dice compared to Command cause shock damage.|

2641|2641|2009-07-15 16:45:09|widderslainte|The Eastern Wastes|Along the frigid coast of the North Sea, where the Gose River drains out from the mountains, sit the Eastern Wastes.  Centered around the ruins of Demenian, a city that the Storm Mother all but wiped from the land in her wrath, are small villages and roving bands of Maetah and mixed blooded people left to the wilderness.  While not as barren as the Plaguelands of the west, the xenophobia of the inhabitants can be just as dangerous.  During the height of the Chlendi Empire, their fear of a return of the grey plague led them to migrate disease populations (no matter how minor) to work camps in the peninsula by Demenian.  As the bureaucracy spread, political enemies and undesirables joined the populace.  As the Chlendi might waned, the villages of the Eastern Wastes were left to their own direction and communication with the cities of (now) Argaevaligne and the Minkush River Valley ended.  The villages became isolated and inbred, and some joined the Kuzak mountain tribes, a Heteri people to the south.  Some say an exile noble built his own domain in the ruins, calling upon Maetah and Chlendi sorceries to extend his life.  Others says the exile did exist, but his magicks brought down the wrath of the Storm Mother which leveled Demenian, and he travels between villages in search of a glimpse of sanity and hospitality.|

2643|2643|2009-08-05 17:26:17|widderslainte|Tomb City of the Polog|Recent earthquakes have uncovered a pass in the mountains north of Narrosh.  Expeditions from the Commerce Guild have found ruins of a small city or ceremonial center once called Luumb (to the best of their deciphering). Small amounts of gold jewelry have been recovered among the squat towers and domes.  The ruins lack staircases and have numerous murals of red-eyed faces along the ramps that take their place.  Wax-sealed tombs line the interior walls, but no remains have been found in any of the excavations.  Large circular pits are scattered throughout the center, each having scattered remains of humanoid, large quadroped, and small rodent bones.  According to Heteri history, Putuv II ruled the mountain tribes of this region that his father had conquered.  There is no mention in their legends of a city or location called Luumb.|
