# Currency & Coinage
A few words on currency in Northern Rhiat:

Controlled chaos. Between crumbling socieities, conquests, and trade wars, few nations have remained resolute long enough to maintain stable internationally recognized currencies.

* Argaevaligne Silver Crown - round coin, with the visage of the "King" on one side, and a knight superimposed on the sigil of the Church of Thedine on the other. Accepted in most northern towns. Gold trade bars and copper "bits" are also minted.
* Posi - common coin of the Eschlatli Empire. Still minted in Vensat. Gold, octoganal shape. Heads is a crown, tails is an image of Emperor's tower.
