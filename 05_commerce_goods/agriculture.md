* Heteri Root Vegetables
* Giit - Major crop in the central Rhait. Git grows in moist areas - river valleys and swampy land. It is planted in mid spring, and grows to full height in Miist (early to mid summer). At maturity it has large corn-like stalks, which sprout multiple ears. The git ears are covered with large numbers (100-200) of red-brown, soft fluffy grains. These grains have a natural texture similar to cooked rice. Common preparation is the boil the git, which rapidly reaches a thick, gruelish, consistency.
