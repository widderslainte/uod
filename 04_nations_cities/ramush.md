# Ramush

The Duchy of Ramush is the last bastion of pure Chlendi culture in Rhiat. The nation survives despite vigous aggression by the Argaevaligne from its inception, surviving merely be its position along the major water route between Vensat and the North Sea and its control over notable mountain passes. The Ramushian culture has grown and mutation from its Chlendi roots and insular nature as a peculiar adaptation of the specialized nation. Its arts, philosophy, and theology and a sliver of traditional Chlendi civilization a millenia ago, and its agriculture, material culture, and diet have warped in response to the limited resources of the swamps.

This region is officially open to all religions. But from the cause and date of its formation, the Duchy has been run by, and used as a haven for, religions often fobidden elsewhere. The strongest of these factions are: Mustyoch and Hilinavyu of the traditional Maetah pantheon, and a number of Chlendi spirits.

* **Who Really Rules:** Duke Zihragris of Pasdani. While he holds equal sway officially, the othr dukes and barons generally defer to his opinions.

## History

Ramush was once the western county in Argaevaligne, established as a frontier along the hills and swamps. When the Society of the Black Earth began intensive missionary action in the county, they discovered that the budding towns had already been infested by the priests and adherents of other, 'unsavory' faiths. With support of the Argaevalignian crown, they mounted an inquisition in the region, but underestimated the relevance of these blasphemous faiths. The priest faced a revolt amongst the peasantry, and called in military force. While the military endeavor was successful in communities closest to the Argaevalignian heartland, the settlements of Ramush County simply spread into the swamps and hills. The county borders were then revised to only include the retaken communities, and the King and priesthood assumed the border communites and decay without royal support. They were wrong.
