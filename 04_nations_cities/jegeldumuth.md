## Jegeldumuth

City originally carved from the side of the cliffs as a Ningala fortress. Conquered by the Chlendi at the opening of the 2nd Epoch as their first act of war against the Heteri and their allies. The city has an open series of mines which drain into the Minkush, and yield copper ore and amberite, an amber coloured crystal favoured by the Chlendi.

* **Eskla Temples and Shrines** - along the western cliffside, toward the north of the city, stands are row of once-grand temples and shrines.
