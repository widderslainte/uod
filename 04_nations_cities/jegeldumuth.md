## Jegeldumuth

City originally carved from the side of the cliffs as a Ningala fortress. Conquered by the Chlendi at the opening of the 2nd Epoch as their first act of war against the Heteri and their allies. The city has an open series of mines which drain into the Minkush, and yield copper ore and amberite, an amber coloured crystal favoured by the Chlendi.

The city of divided by the Minkush river - the western side hosts the most prominent and wealthy, while the eastern side is dominated by winding neighborhoods of rundown Maetah and Heteri homes interspersed with the most basic and undesired businesses - clothes-dyeing, butchers, and their ilk. Underneath both cliffsides are mazes of tunnels and mines, most still active.  They open to the cliffaces for air and access, and sprawling wooden bridges and scaffolding line both sides and crosss above the river.  At the base lie a dozens of small docks on the western riverside and a nest of Chlendi stilt-huts upon the east, the latter clustered around the mine drainage tunnels.

* **Eskla Temples and Shrines** - along the western cliffside, toward the north of the city, stands are row of once-grand temples and shrines.
