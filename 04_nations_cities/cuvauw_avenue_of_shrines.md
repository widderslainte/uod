# The Avenue of Shrines

The cul-de-sac in central Cuvauw holds the shrines to traditional Maetah deities. Each follows similar form, lining the sides of the street, with the largest at the end. Each shrine is built upon a 6' - 8' high cut stone "plaza", with a central 8'-10' wide staircase leading up from the street. At the foot of each staircase is a statue depicting the god. All the statues are cut from the same stone in similar style, unclothed, standing straight up and with few features. The temple and shrines themselves are one to three stories, mostly of timbered mudbrick. The roofs fan out in pagoda style with each story, and are covered in slate tiles of natural colours.

The shrines are laid out in the following order, starting on the left side of the lane, following the cul-de-sac to the right side: Thedine, Hilinavyu, Ubo, Eluus, Musthyoch, Lob, Storm Mother, Uzhidhomi.
