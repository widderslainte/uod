# Asklor

Before the Eschlatli union with the Maetah peoples, Asklor was the capitol of the Chendi. Located at the base of the western mountains,  the city was originally a mining community just south of the swamps founded by Qod Lilotle, Clan of the Violet Glory.

Asklor once held the culture's great scholarly institutions, home to schools of sorcery as well as the National Observatory for the Clan of the Blue Moon, who traditionally headed the Astrologer's Guild. The city was built far from waterways or exiting communities to mine a deposit of the sacred amberite, which was dug out from beneath the city itself, within it's towering walls. During the Mindat incursions the capitol was moved to Minkaraph to assist in military planning. Although the city is now only sparsely populated, mining continues to
this day.
