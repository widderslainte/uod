## Boglai

Coastal town along the eastern coast of the southern jungles.  Built up from a small fishing village and pirate hideout into a fortified foothold in the region by the Mindat.  Taken by the Heteri from Ghikarn'gai after the Mindat fled the region, it is now a stopover for shipping coming from the north.   

It is ruled by Vuhwul Murov of the Leg Crack, of the Naggai tribe.

 _The hills behind the small city are lined caves and tunnels and contain the Grand Temple of Hilinavyu._  

 The town is slowly being crowded against the western walls separating it from the swampy jungle. Little remains of the 

Heteri style clan markers are used upon gates and entranceways.
