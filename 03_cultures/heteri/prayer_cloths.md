# Prayercloths
The term "prayercloths" actually refers to two distinct styles of the same item. The traditional prayercloth is tied as a sash at the waist, hung across the shoulders for more formal occasions, and sometimes tied from a saddle or spear when on horseback. It will contain the symbol of Utan and other gods, and sometimes the glyph of the person's clan. More decorative versions will have an actually prayer stitched into the cloth.

The other style is genealogical. Most Heteri are illiterate, but recognize a few letters and glyphs. Virtually all know the symbols of local clans. 'Clan cloths' are used in the teaching of one's ancestry. The cloths themselves are a heavy cotton or wool, with symbols and glyphs stitched in. Children learn the symbol of the their clan is which is added at the top. As they learn their ancestry, more names (often in symbolic form) are added. Since this can get very long, often only the clan founder, and the person's most recent ancestors are listed. Most families will have one or more prayercloths detailing the whole lineage, or as much as is known. Upon maturity (age 13 for males), young adults add their own name to the end of the prayer cloth. Often a grandmother will create a copy of the prayercloth and mount it upon leather, so it can be hung from a bridle or saddle
