# Mindat
The Mindat (min-DOT) are the dark skinned peoples of the south, whose empire is said to have been founded thousands of years ago. Their presence in the Rhiat is normally limited to academic and magickal gatherings, and a number of their philosophers serve on the courts of nobles across the continent. The Mindat are known to the people of the north for their invasion of the Heteri city-states hundreds of years ago, which led to the founding Ghikarn-naggai and development of the tradeports of Vennosat, and the export of numerous varieties of smoking herbs, some which have addictive and dream-enhancing qualities. The Mindat are also said to have brought slavery of nogs, small imp-like creatures, to the northern nations.

## Early Mindat History
The Mindat were original a collection of herding tribes in the southern foothills of the Jakinta Mountains. The Mindat was the Proto-Heteri term for “gathering". Many tribes of the region originally took part in the Mindat, but the populations that would later take the roles of nobles in the burgeoning empire were the clan Zheltize, meaning “from" or “between the rivers."

## Mindaron Empire 

The Mindaron Empire straddled the Jakinth Mountains at its peak, adapting to the vast coastal jungles to the south, and the dry plains and desert in the rain-shadows of the ranges in peaks. The mountains were the prime factor in the rise of the Empire, as prosperous lords used the developing bronze industry to sweep over the militias of their neighbors. While possession of bronze spears and plates could conquer and unite a few scattered tribes, they were virtually worthless against the united nobles of the Shn-k'varuth homeland, which plagued the Mindat from the beginnings.

Although the strength of Mindaron Empire was along the central coast, ironically it was the descendents of the elder clans who once plagued the burgeoning empire that helped thwart the Chlendi southern expansion and intimidate the growing Maldaer kingdoms into stagnation. While the Chlendi armies were comprised of swarming, dedicated infantries and bolstered by covens of depraved sorcerers, they were no match for the sweeping attacks of the Mindaron horsemen. A people raised in swamp and marsh could not match the equestrian skills of the Mindat Cavalry. While a consummate tactical victory, the concurrent defeat of the two most populous societies on the North Sea Coast led to dire consequences for the Mindarons. The crushed nations formalized the cultural interdependent that had been creeping throughout border city over the past few generations, leading to the Ahaeti Covenant, while was the basis for the Esclatli Empire. The extent of Mindat success in the skirmishes of Ghika Plains ironically led to their eventual downfall.

## Military

The Mindat are feared for their massive armies wielding long, curved blades and protected by carapace armours. They utilise cavalry mounted on riding lizards, and great reptilian war-beasts two or three stories high. They are one of the few nations to know the arts of crafting airships.

## Social Culture 

Mindat social structure is not organized around the nuclear family. After weening, children are separated from their biological parents into small groups of 8-12 children of a similar age and ethnic background. These groups are raised communally by adults in the immediate area, and could be considered a clan-like structure, though no lineages are prescribed. As an individual child's potential is noticed, they might be moved to a different kingroup, though this rarely occurs after the age of 10. The ties of the kingroups are maintained throughout one's lifetim, however upon marriage, the wife genrally joins the males kingroup. Polygamy is practiced among weathier citizens, and the ability to maintain multiple spouses is solely an economic issue. On a community level, the kingroups are joined into tribes, based on the shared parenting groups. Nowadays this a geographically convenience, but was more noticable in earlier times, when nomadic tribes would migrate throughout the year. Inheritance passes to fellow kingroup members, and then flows to the oldest male in any kingroups.

Upon maturity, each Mindat is tested for citizenship. These nature of the tests vary by the tribe, kingroup, and social function of the indiviual. Minimally it consists of a mentoring process of three Mindat citizens who then must approve the individual for citizenship. Upon achieving citizenship, one is able to carry weapons without license, own property, vote in tribal elections, and mentor others for citizenship. Citizenship is possible for those of non-Mindat descent, though the mentoring process is more stringent and lengthy.

## Religion
See also: Mindat Religion

A thousand years ago, Mindat sorcerors evoked their deities into corporeal form and ritually slew them, using their energies to power great magicks. They see themselves as free of "slavery" to extraplanar beings and seek to harness their powers within. The White Book is a guide to this process. It is the central religious text of the Mindat and has never been adequeted translated out of the Mindat language, and while quoted frequently, is never read aloud. It describes a process and trails of harnessing one's soul, which is called "walking the labyrinth". The book itself is bound in white leather and is upwards of 400 pages. Many of the pages, or parts of the pages are left blank to be filled in by the adherent recording his progress or completing exercises. Other religious movements are offically banned in Mindat, but in practice are tolerated as long they refrain from public displays or other forms of social upheaval. Common cults include: The Revival of the Old Gods, The Sarpha Cult, The Walkers of the Labyrinth, The Children of the Highest, and The Way of the Flesh.

## Magick

### Mindat Wizards 
The Mindat see all forms of magick as just another type of learning. Wizards (and other academics) among the Mindat are the only ones allowed to wear white robes. There are also identifiable by a flat-brimmed, almost bowler-style, hat. A proper Mindat wizard would be schooled in alchemy, a yoga-like form of meditation, the creation of amulets and talismans, and theurgy.


### Mechanics
_Craft Talisman, Less [Item Creation]_ 

_Work in Progress_ - only works with certain spells or classes of spells. Will define list at later time. Prerequisite: Spellcaster Level 1+

Benefit: Character can create a talisman, a minor magickal item, to link spells to. Creation of the talisman requires 1000 GP and 100 XP per level of spell it can link, and can only ever be linked to one spell. Linking a spell to a talisman takes up a "spell slot" until the spell is discharged, dispelled, or released, upon which the spell slot can be used as normal (with proper rest, etc). A properly linked talisman can be used to summon forth a spell throuh a single verbal component and may be done as a free action. This does not in any way eliminate the other requirements or components necessary for casting the spell normally.
