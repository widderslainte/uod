## Chlendi Numbers

It's been a long and crazy week in Dr. Thoad's lab, so instead of
treatise on Chlendi Land Squid anatomy, you get some numbers.

zero - nal
one - yal
two - kik
three - riv
four - daj
five - zis
six - dil
seven - vidne
eight - cisde
nine - liip
ten - pivni
twenty - kikni
fifty - zisni
one hundred - pivix

I don't have my full notes on Chlendi language handy, so I'll stop
here for today.  I have some recollection of their number system being
base-20, but that may be Mayan chocolate getting in my Uod peanut
butter (in which case ten becomes just "piv", and twenty sees the
first occurrence of the "ni" suffix - but Chlendi isn't a true
agglutinating language, but I digress).
