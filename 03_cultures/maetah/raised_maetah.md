# Raised Maetah
** If you were raised Maetah... **

## In Argaevaligne:

### Home & Food

Your largest meal is at midday.  Rest and replenish for another afternoon of work.
You don't consider dogs or horses to be food. Swine, fish, fowl, rice, and leafy vegetables are common ingredients.
It is uncommon to kill your own food, unless your an adult in a swine raising family.  You have probably fished though or perhaps killed a chicken once or twice.
Families eat together, or you eat with you shift in the fields.  A thatched hut to protect from elements at minimum, but your family probably has an old table with benches or stools at home.
Rice and fruit wines are common, as are distilled spirits in the evening. A variety of plant leaves may be smoked or chewed relaxing. 
Chamberpots are common in villages, through families with larger holdings may have an outpost.  There are strict rules about latrine construction in the fields and in rural areas.

### Work & Travel

* Only the well off have horses.  Maybe if you're the reeve or a artisan in town.  You probably have experience with some small boats for fishing or navigating the small rivers.
* Unless you were drafted in the Church's military, you've probably never been beyond the community fields and the nearest village.
* You follow the skills of your family, or hope to join the church hierarchy.  Most raise swine, run small fishing boats, or tend to rice and amaranth fields.

### Weather

* The summers are temperate, but moist.  The winters have vicious storms, which alternate between rain and snow.  The increases to the northeast and inland.
* Cold is the temperature when you stop working the fields.  Hot is the temperature where it's nice to be in the rice and amaranth fields.

### Entertainment & Aesthetics

* Songs that are sung in the fields, stay in the fields.  Stories are told in the evening, usually mocking the nobility or the church (if none of the their minions are nearby), or tales of the fantastic. Flutes and other wind instruments are common.
* Carving and engraving are common art forms.  Scarification and embedding bits of copper or amberite in the skin are the typical forms of body modification.  Hair is kept long, except in the case of slaves.

### Weapons and Warfare

* You're handing with an axe and could probably use a polearm if needed.  Unless you're in a border militia or military, you probably don't even have a sword in your family.
* You may have seen a man killed for punishment, but have not killed yourself unless you're in a border militia.
