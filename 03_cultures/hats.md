# Common Headwear Styles in the Rhiat

* **Brimmed Bowler** - traditional Mindat - certain sides are curled or flattened to denote profession or status - became popular among universities, academics, and wizards.
* **Turbin** - Chlendi - during Eschlatli period turbans became
fashionable among upper class. They are perfumed for style, and also scented to keep away insects in the swamps.
* **Tapered Hide** - Heteri - Traditional head covering is an embroidered
leather hood, which wraps around the neck or chest as a sash or scarf. Strings of beads, feathers, braided hair & fabric used as decor.


Hats are generally forbidden in Argaevaligne. The nobility may choose to wear styles they prefer, and the Church of Thedine has its own ritual garb. Hoods, often lines with furs, are the typical hearwear among the lowerclasses. Helms are only allowed when blade is worn on belt. There are ornate style of hair braiding, and beads and other jewelry are often woven in.

Modern fashions have evolved from the Mindat "brimmed bowler style". In the south, many Heteri have taken to wearing a wide, flatbrimmed version to shield from the sun. Along the coast, this same style is worn, in fancier materials, with the brim pinned up in the front or sides. The height of fashion is now in Vennosat, and the Minkush River Valley cities, where nobles and fops try to outdo each other with ornate, uncomfortable hats of expensive materials, lace trim, and rare feathers and embelishments.
