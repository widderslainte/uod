1.0  Magic Rules

1.1 General LotFP Casting - Test Rules


* Level of spell’s power determined by the caster’s level[a]
* Spells can be cast as lower (caster) level
* Start with three random spells, no read magic
* Comprehend Languages will allow reading and transcription of spellbooks and scrolls
* Rules I’m not likely to use:
   * Prepare one spell per caster level level
   * Cast one spell per caster level


1.1.1 Risky Casting from LotFP

Save or roll on miscast table for the following conditions - penalty to save for multiple conditions

* Casting after per day spell limits reaching (all spells expended)
* Casting spell that has not been prepared
* Casting from other’s spellbook or scroll
* Casting while encumbered
* Casting while taking damage
* Casting a spell for the first time
* Casting a spell while not at full hit points (ugh)

1.2  Chlendi Magic

1.2.1 Chlendi Spirit Summoning 

This spell/ritual is largely based off the Summon spell from page 134 of the current (as of Jan 2019) Lamentations of the Flame Princess rules.  Situations not covered by this description should be referred to those rules or your core rules.

Unless something goes horribly wrong, which is quite possible, this does not normally rip a hole in space and time.  The caster is summoning a spirit with a connection to the current plane, where tied to nature, an object, or material link of the dead.


Once the Summon spell is cast, there are a number of steps to resolve:

1. The caster chooses the intended Power of the Summoned Entity
2. The caster makes a saving throw versus Magic
3. Determine the Entity’s Form - see below
4. Determine the Entity’s Powers
5. Resolve the Domination Roll


Step 2: Determine the Entity’s Form:

* Follow the original rules as written, with the following modifiers when
  Chlendi

* If you can touch a link to a spirit (grave earth, tree of a the tree spirit,
  etc) make a second saving throw versus magic - if successful choose the
closest form.  If you fail, proceed as normal

* If you can not touch a link, but still make the initial saving throw roll
  d12 twice and pick which result your prefer.

* Use appropriate sacrifices (not usually human) to attract the proper spirit
  and modify the form roll further.

* Dealing with spirits is an important part of the magic system in Ghastly
  Affair, my Gothic OGL game.

 It's Magician class is deeply informed by “historical” and literary magic. It
can utilize Ceremonies to summon spirits or affect targets at a distance,
create Talismans that confer constant magical effects, and activate Pacts that
cause spirits to create extraordinary effects in return for sacrifices or
services. Of course, a Magician could also cause an “Elf Stroke” in a victim
by using her wand or magic dagger. By deciding whether a character primarily
uses Incantations, Ceremonies, Talismans, or Pacts, the Class can easily be
run as an academic occultist, religious theurgist, witch, or even a tribal
shaman. There are also suggested rules for the effects of the most common
herbs and drugs used historically by witches and sorcerers, if you want to
include that in your game.

Ghastly Affair also includes a “Demon Hunter” Class. The class is skilled in combat, and can identify disguised supernatural beings (and knows their weaknesses). 

The Game has a “Faith” mechanic that allows any virtuous person to attempt to ward off supernatural evil. If your Demon Hunter can keep herself from becoming twisted by the horrors and immorality of the world around her, she can repulse demons.
