## Pantheon

#### Utan the Destroyer
_God of Warfare and Sovereignty, the Earth and The Sky_

Utan the Destroyer is the god of Warfare, the Earth & the Sky (in metaphoric terms). All the other deities are considered his slaves. The Heteri people recognize him as the greatest of gods, but hold that he ultimately cares little for his people. Legend has it that Utan was the first chief of the Heteri people and slew the elder gods, gaining immortality by consuming their blood and flesh. From them he learned the secrets of the world and taught his people the ways of herding and husbandry. He raised his brothers and sisters, other chieftains up to the heavens to rules beside him.

#### Hilinavyu 
The Coal God, governs mining and construction, metals, fires, and the hearth. Hilinavyu was the father of the Gods and keeper of the secrets of the mountains. Priests seek "secrets under the mountains" in Hilinavyu's name and blackness the skin around the eyes when acting in his honor.  Heteri seek out Hilinavyu's blessing over the hearth in a new home or other construction. Large temple complexes devoted to Hilinvayu can be found in Narrosh and Bolog. Status of Hilinavyu are always carved and depict the eyes surrounding by black or represented by shiny coal orbs.

#### Eluus
_Fertility and Agriculture_

Eluus is also the Maetah Goddess of Vegetation and Fertility, but her worship originated long ago among the Heteri. Her colour is red, sacred number 4, and scared animal the goat.It was common for women, especially widows and those who lost their children to serve Eluus, and many would act healers and midwives for the village. Women who were pregnant, hoping to become pregnant, or had ill children would keep an idol to Eluus hidden below their (or their sick child's) bed.  New families and marriages seeking children will burying an idol below the ground upon a house is built. Children born with red-hair are considered bless by Eluus and to bound for strength and good health.

Prayers to Eluus are said at dawn, and weekly worship is done before dawn at the beginning of the work week. Annual feasts are held at the beginning of spring, midsummer, and at harvest time. The central act of the spring celebration is for worshipers to have sex in their fields the night before planting. It is common for priests and priestesses of Eluus to participate, usually in exchange for an offering to the temple. During the summer celebrations, sacrifices of a young calf are offered to the god, slaughtered by the local priest, and left in the center of fields to be devoured by birds. If the whole carcass was gone by morning, the field was especially blessed by the goddess.
