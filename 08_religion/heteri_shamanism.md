_"Shamans perform a variety of functions depending upon their respective cultures;[48] healing,[49][50] leading a sacrifice,[51] preserving traditions by storytelling and songs,[52] fortune-telling,[53] and acting as a psychopomp ("guide of souls").[54] A single shaman may fulfill several of these functions.[48]"_
