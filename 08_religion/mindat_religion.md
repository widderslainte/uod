More than a millennia ago, the Mindat worshipped an elaborate pantheon of Gods, whose heirarchy and functions mirrored the social structures of the Empire, and it's breadth of influence. With the rise of the Saghhit Dynasty in 1996, the priesthood suffered numerous changes. The practices of the God-Kings were abolished, and the heir to the Emperor's Throne abdicated in favour of his younger brother. Instead, Wukein travelled west to the lands of the Dushanni, north to the pox-ridden homeland of the Chlendi, and south the forbidden jungles of the Shn-Kvaruth, lengendary enemies of the Mindat. He brought back teachings and knowledge from the lands, and began a radical reform of the Mindat temple structure.

### The Sacrifice of the Old Gods
While the war against the Chlendi at a standstill, it the Wukein's time for action. He plan would come to fruition, striking down the his peoples' foes abroad and above. A thousand years ago, Mindat sorcerors evoked their deities into corporeal form and ritually slew them, using their energies to power greak magics. And while the Mindat's conquest of the west ultimately failed, their knowledge led them to break the back of the Chlendi dominance of the north and force them back to the swamps. 

Today other religious movements are officially banned in Mindat, but in practice are still tolerated as long they refrain from public displays or other forms of social upheaval.  Common cults include: The Revival of the Old Gods, The Sarpha Cult, The Walkers of the Labyrinth, The Children of the Highest, and the Way of the Flesh.

### The White Book
The White Book is the central religious text of the Mindat. They see themselves as free of "slavery" to extraplanar beings and seek to harness their powers within. The White Book is a guide to this process. It is the central religious text of the Mindat and has never been adequated translated out of the Mindat language, and while quoted frequently, is never read aloud. It describes a process and trials of harnessing one's soul,  which is alluding to using the metaphor of walking a labyrinth. The book itself is bound in white leather and is upwards of 400 pages. Many of the pages, or parts of the pages are left blank to be filled in by the adherent recording his progress or completing exercises. 

#### The Eidolon
The Eidolon is the true, inner self of the human soul, and the focus of the teaching of the White Book. Metaphors from the text often refer to it as the "hidden twin".

### Standard Elements
Creation
Divination
Morality
The Afterlife

#### Miscellaneous Practices
Stitch Binding - As a Mindat beginning to harness the power of the Eidolon, and temper it through invocations, the danger of this path increases. To ward against the under influence of invoked entities, binding wards will be stitched through the flesh of the vessel. The tradtional stitching material is woven hair grown during a period of fasting.
