
A thousand years ago, Mindat sorcerors evoked their deities into corporeal form and ritually slew them, using their energies to power greak magics.  They see themselves as free of "slavery" to extraplanar beings and seek to harndess their powers within.

The White Book is a guide to this process.  It is the central religious text of the Mindat and has never been adequated translated out of the Mindat language, and while quoted frequently, is never read aloud.  It describes the process and trails of harnessing one's soul, which is alluding to using the metaphor of walking a labyrinth.  The book itself is bound in white leather and is upwards of 400 pages.  Many of the pages and whole parts of the book are left black to be completed by the adherent recording his progress or completing exercises.  

Other religious movements are officially banned in Mindat, but in practice are tolerated as long they refrain from public delaysor other forms of social upheaval.  Common cults include: The Revival of the Old Gods, The Sarpha Cult, The Walkers of the Labyrinth, The Children of the Highest, and the Way of the Flesh.
