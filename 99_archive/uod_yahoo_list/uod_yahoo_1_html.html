The Maetah is the culture that Argaevaligne<br> developed from.  Much like Rome was polytheistic<br> before Constantine converted them to Xtianity. There<br> are other communities of Maetah, and others that<br> follow their pantheon.

All<br> plants and animals (including humanity) were seen as his children and<br> servants, in one manner or another.  Particular animals were idolized in<br> beast cults, which were subservient to Musthyoch, and stereotypical<br> qualities of these animals (strength of bulls) were used to represent<br> other gods.  For example, Thedine was originally a bull cult, showing<br> the strength and stability of the bull, and the earth with the<br> connection that bulls (and oxen) were used in cultivation.  Musthyoch<br> was also known as the 'Emperor of All Flesh' and is pictured as a<br> blue-skinned humanoid, although this imagery does not pass on to modern<br> times.  By the period of the Eschaltli Empire, Mustyoch is idolized as a<br> short, hooded figure of undetermined gender.  In later times (early<br> Maldaer colonies on the North Sea plateau), two of these beast cults<br> came to prominence:  Lob and Ubo, the sons of Musthyoch.</div></html>|

The original pantheon was a selection of deities<br> brought over by the original ethnic stock, and modified by the<br> acclimation to the geography of settlers.  The southern (proper) Maetah,<br> who passed this pantheon to modern peoples, also had a great deal of<br> influence from Heteri (and thus Mindat) religion.  When the Chlendi<br> moved in the North Sea plateau, we see two differing syncretic trends:<br> The transformation of Thedine/Tegairne into a monotheistic moral entity<br> and the envelopment of Chlendi spirits into the mythology of the region.</div></html>|

His primary patrons were among the people of the farms<br> and husbandries, the fat and happy overlords of the lands that the<br> majority of the Maetah population worked.  Lob's lineage, the Clan of<br> the Fattened Young, existed in opposition to the agricultural Clan of<br> the Fertile Earth, and its subsidiary lineages, who toiled in the<br> fields. <br> <br> But upon migration, the Maetah found it difficult to adapt their<br> fattened hogs to the rough winters of the northern plateau.  Facing a<br> cold response from the budding agriculturalists that followed Thedine,<br> and even colder lonely winter, they turned to the only clan of the<br> interior lands they had not alienated, the hunters.  The early Maetah<br> hunters were an odd lot.  They were among the most physically fit, but<br> who neither had the interest nor the aptitude to take up the rough and<br> monotonous agricultural life of the farmers.  Many other were<br> opportunist who saw the struggles of the tribe in the new environment,<br> and took the chance to gain in status.  Many others were low or no<br> status, and both nothing to loose, and no other choice.<br> <br> The Clan of the Fattened Young saw promise in the study of the hunting<br> community, and still commodities from the homelands, as wells high<br> ranking daughters to offer these clan less populations, in retune for<br> their support.  The Clan leaders first sought to interbreed the primary<br> prey of the hunters, the hardy Northland Boar, into their dwindling<br> herds of the swine.  The plan would not come to fruition for many years,<br> at which point the lineages of the clan which had intermarried with the<br> hunters rose in prominence above the herders, who barely could maintain<br> their lives, much less their status.<br> <br> While the lineages that followed Lob grew in status, the gained little<br> respect.  After facing hardship in their early years, they took bitter<br> glee in extorting fellow tribe members for wealth and goods in exchange<br> for sustenance. The shamans and priest of Lob grew isolated fro the<br> tribal spiritual community, but did not desert the gods.  Many of the<br> clan members did however, choosing to solely venerate the Tusked God.<br> The faith did not disrespect or falter in supplicance to the pantheon,<br> but the elements of the Lob became more prominent in the popular<br> culture.  The hides, hooves, and teeth, especially the tusk became power<br> symbols, and soon fetishes of the people. <br> <br> When the Chlendi came, the people of Lob fought with the most<br> resistance, as they had the most to lose.  After years of the struggle,<br> ancient families had relearned the place n society, and finally regained<br> lost status.  Locked in the servitude among the slave farmers was not<br> the life for them. Their martial and hunting skills were hone for the<br> struggled, but their lacked the numbers and initiative to mount a<br> campaign against the Chlendi.  Instead the Clan broke off, and built<br> small, mobile villages in the wilderness, slowly moving the southwest,<br> and closer the expanding Mindat civilization.  They lost took with the<br> hunt of the boar, and were forced to expand their forays to include<br> other species.  Still the boar, and its lord, was their savoir and<br> patron, saving them from starvation, extermination, and slavery.</div></html>|

Balaconth was first<br> settled as a few small city-states by Heteri lords a millenia or two<br> ago. Only one of the cities, Akklai Point, exists as an occupied<br> community today.  Balaconth has a mix of ethnic backgrounds, but Heteri<br> dominates.  A wide range of religious practices are observed.<br> <br> After the Eschlatli fell, Balaconth continued on as if nothing had<br> happened.  They maintained the political and mercantile system as<br> before, although on a smaller and more privatized scale.  Unfortunately<br> it did not have the same benefits militarily, and slowly lost out to the<br> burgeoning Commerce Guild in Vensat.  Subsequently, the subterranean<br> goblin nation of Khoshinvak boiled forth from the caverns and overran<br> Balaconth a few years ago.<br> <br> When the invasion took place, balaconth consisted of a score of small<br> villages, two cities, and a handful of decrepit or deserted forts.  It<br> had no standing army, merely enough guards and mercenaries to maintain<br> order.  Farmers and outlaws posed n resistance for the Goblin Queen's<br> armies.<br> <br> Today the nation is under the whims and desires of goblin queen, who<br> remains safely underground.  There are from time to time outcropping of<br> violent resistance, but they are largely unsuccessful.  In fact, the<br> Khoshinvak only control the government and military, so for most of the<br> peasants and lower class, life has changed little.</div></html>|

Her colour<br> is red, sacred number 4, and scared animal the goat.  In modern times<br> she is seen as the source of the wild, chaotic, and dangers of the<br> world by the priests of Aegaevaligne.  She is the siste of Ubo and<br> Lob, and the adversary of Thedine.  Eluus is said the be the favoured<br> child of Mustyoch, the God of Blood and Life.  Priests were almost<br> always specifically devoted to Eluus, though they would inherit the<br> duties of Lob or even Thedine if none of their devotees were present.<br>  It was common for women, especially widows and those who lost their<br> children to serve Eluus, and many would act healers and midwives for<br> the village.  Women who were pregnant, hoping to become pregnant, or<br> had ill children would keep an idol to Eluus hidden below their (or<br> their sick child's) bed.  This is still in practice in Argaevaligne,<br> as is the tradition of burying an idol below the ground upon a house<br> is built.  Children born with red-hair are considered bless by Eluus<br> and to bound for strength and good health.<br> <br> Prayers to Eluus are said at dawn, and weekly worship is done before<br> dawn at the beginning of the work week.  Annual feasts are held at the<br> beginning of spring, midsummer, and at harvest time.  The central act<br> of the spring celebration is for worshippers to have sex in their<br> fileds the night before planting.  It is common for priesta and<br> priestesses of Eluus to participate, usually in exhcange for an<br> offering to the temple.  During the summer celebrations, sacrifices of<br> a young calf are offered to the god, slaughtered by the local priest,<br> and left in the ceter of fields to be devoured by birds.  If the whole<br> carcass was gone by morning, the field was especially blessed by the<br> goddess.</div></html>|

This<br> method would turn to be most effective among the Maetah because of the<br> primacy of the agricultural faith in the economy and livelihood of the<br> culture.

The people<br> organized into small familial clans, most worshipping a few patron<br> spirits.  The most prominent of the still extant clans are: Mourning<br> Legions, Everlasting Bog, Spider Trees, Marble Hammer, Bronze Blade,<br> Violet Glory, Noble-light-people, and Mottled Bull.  They spread south<br> to conquer Heteri tribe in what is now Vensat, and had many decades of<br> conflict with the Maetah.<br> <br> The Chlendi enslaved whole towns of Maetah peasants as laborers, and<br> eventually united with other populations of both Heteri and Maetah<br> against the advance of the Mindat.  The massive bureaucracy could not<br> maintain a network of such diversity, and began splintering before it<br> could reach a millennia of age, as smaller cstates and split began<br> self-governence in their own interest.  Nowadays small villages of<br> Chlendi dot the western Rhiat, but the only significant populations<br> are found in Ramush.  However the clans are reuniting in other larger<br> cities and seeking out their heritage in the swamps and misty hills of<br> the north.<br> <br> In ancient times, the Chlendi lived off the swamps, eating shellfish,<br> snakes, swamprats and fowl.  Philters and herbal concontions were made<br> the from the plants and fungi.  A potent incense from the toxic black<br> algae was used to conjure spirits.  <br> <br> <br> Religion & Magick<br> -----------------<br> <br> Chlendi cosmology describes the creation of the world as an Ex Nihilo<br> event in the universe.  At the time of creations spirits from across<br> the planes and universe wrre drawn to the infant sphere.  The<br> formation of the spehere created lines of omnessesence (similar to ley<br> lines) between the Rhiat and (the continental region) and other stars,<br>  The confluence of these lines formed around the constellatins,<br> creatng numerous gates, engulfing and transporting spirits to the sphere.<br> <br> The Chlendi were polytheists and animists in the broadest sense. <br> Spirits were everywhere and in everything.  Priests and shamans wrote<br> encylopediac theologies and hierarchies, noting spirits of various<br> powers.  Some were worshiped as nearly deific, why others were<br> ectoplasmic slaves to be ordered about by any within and inkling of<br> magickal skill.<br> <br> The Chlendi bury their dead in subterranean tombs of stone.  Because<br> this is not practical in the swamps, indivudals are submerged and<br> covered in cairns of stone, often nearby deceased family members. <br> Chlendi faith posits that the dead dweel amongst the spirits, ofetn<br> working for them in the spirit realm.  The most reknown of Chlendi<br> mystics and warriors people objects of worship themselves. Ancestors<br> and favoured spirits are idolized in small clay or metal figures that<br> are kept at home or carried by travellers.  <br> <br> They mastered the arts of summoning and astrology building shrines<br> along veins of mystical ores.  Their most prized material is amberite,<br> a golden translucent rock which is carved into jewelry, idols, and<br> other religious object.<br> <br> Material Culture<br> --------------------------<br> The staple of traditional Chlendi garbed is a colourful perfumed<br> turbin.  The scent is engineered to hide the musk of the swamp as well<br> as repel the abundent insects.  The colors are a matter of fasion, and<br> the pin or broach holding it in place is the most prominent symbol of<br> ones economic status.<br> <br> In the swamps, most homes and small buildings are raised platforms on<br> stilts, with wooden structure and thatched roof.  Large building are<br> constructed and large stone plazas which rise out of the water and<br> level off swampy ground.<br> <br> The original homeland of the Chlendi did not have horses, and with<br> most of their communities in the wetlands, it was rarely pratical to<br> adopt them.  In the swamp variety of flatt bottom boats and skiffs are<br> used for personal and commodity transport, the largest of which are<br> pulled by ibisis, a species of larged tamed amphbious beasts.</div></html>|

Still in use today, the ritual requirtes the subject to be<br> strapped or chain down to a table or other surface while undergoing a<br> painful extraction.  The ritual collects the hate, anger, and<br> agression stored up within a person and distills it into a thick black<br> liquid.

A few small fishing villages and towns line the river<br> downstream to Minkarraph.  High in the mountains, yet protected from<br> the brutal North Sea storms, Cuvauw was a favoured summering spot for<br> the noble and wealthy at the height of the Eschlatli Empire.  The town<br> was originally built to support a mining colony, whose endeavors still<br> produce great wealth in ores and gems for the region.  With the Goblin<br> invasion to the south Cuvauw has become the largest free community in<br> Balaconth, and consequently harbors many noble families of the region,<br> and is building a sizable military presence to defend them.<br> <br> Cuvauw is ruled by Comte Mlash Revuud, cousin of the 'King' of Nipend,<br> and is widely thought to be stern but just.  He is advised by the sage<br> Ocurod, and his uncle, a priest of Thedine.  Ocurod is known as<br> acolyte of Ri-Ephond (Lord of the Earth), the traditional patron deity<br> of Cuvauw.  In recent years, rumour has is that the Comte is merely<br> following the orders of his brother Duke Naffan, a former ruler of<br> Balaconth now in exile from the Goblin Invasion.  <br> <br> Cuvuaw straddles the streams and falls the join just outside the city<br> walls and run west through the midst of the city.  Docks, market<br> squares, and small canals line the waterway, as well as a central<br> bridge that leads north to the palace, militia barracks, and fortified<br> mine entrances.  Two great towers from the smelting houses tower over<br> the southern side and the sit and their plumes of smoke can be seen<br> from miles away.  Butchering, timbering, and other industries reside<br> in the Southern Ward as well and much of the lower class housing.<br> <br> Other notes:<br> Cuvauw is the nearest city to Argaevaligne, but the Church is not a<br> major player in the city.  The Comte's uncle is a priest, but not his<br> closest advisor.  The idea of noble (and wealthy) families retaking<br> their rightful lands from the Goblin Queen falls in line with the<br> Church's ethics.<br> <br> The Jeweler's Guild has always wanted a piece of the action in Cuvauw.<br>  They control the luxury goods trade in the major coastal cities and<br> along the Minkush River.  In Cuvauw they have to go through a few<br> middlemen, seriously cutting into the potential profit. They are<br> heavily opposed by the Commerce Guild.<br> <br> All these noble titles are remnants of when the Eschlatli Empire<br> unified most of the Rhiat, and are stilled passed on hereditarily. <br> Dukes, Barons, Viscounts etc hold title and land, but there is no king<br> or feudal structure over them.  They all lord over small city-state<br> (or less!), but fight for status with $$$.  Back in the days of the<br> Empire, Cuvauw was the Aspen or Cape Cod of the region, where all the<br> families would go to marry their children off to other noble families.<br>  Many still do this, usually in an attempt to consolidate their power.<br>  In the case of the Comte, his only son is currently tucked away in<br> the local asylum.</div></html>|

Among other Heteri,<br> the Tribal affiliation (Polog, Luggai, etc) would be known from the Clan<br> Name.  If you were of noble lineage, you might just say 'Firstname, son of<br> Fathername', as any proper person would recognize the name of your father.  <br> <br> In more modern times, the clans have larger settled and because of some<br> intermixing, some will use 'Firstname Lastname of Cityname' instead of the<br> clan name.

In Ghikarn'gai, they only care<br> about your clan.<br> <br> Vuhwul = Tribal Chief or King<br> Mivehwul = Mayor or Clan Head<br> <br> The Heteri aren't too formal beyond that.  They would use terms like Elder<br> (for age and respect) and Sir (for politeness or unfamiliarity), but I don't<br> know that I have specific Heteri words for those.  Women don't hold title,<br> but would still be respected, and might call them selves "Firstname, son of<br> Fathername" (yes, son) is their father was a chief.  There aren't specific<br> vowels used in female names, but I'll try to come up with lists of common<br> names for each gender.</div></html>|

Requires no contact with the<br> entity at the time of use.  This includes pacts with extraplanar beings.<br> <br> - Physical: Omnessense which natutally occurs in biological or mineral<br> sources.  Most often the item is destroyed in the process of releasing or<br> using the energy.  This includes 'material components', alchemy (in some<br> forms), herbalism, prana, and human/animal sacrifice.  Well-versed sorcerers<br> can view the inherent prana in items or people in a process similar to aura<br> reading.  The magickally gifted actively exhibit a nimbus of omneessence.<br> <br> - Geological: There is power to be found in nature.  Chlendi mystics have<br> hypothesized that "ley lines" follow the vein of the amberite mineral<br> beneath the ground.  Others have harvested power given off by geysers,<br> volcanos, and othe geological phenomena.<br> <br> - Inherent: Although all living creatues have prana to some extent, others<br> are possessed with power to another degree, or have been trained to focus<br> what we all possess.  A cult, "The Children of the Highest", believe they<br> are the descendents of mortal-divine reproduction.  Others such as the<br> followers of the White Book, see all sentient beings are possessed with a<br> "divine spark" which can honed through the training and meditation upon<br> one's 'higher self'.<br> <br> - Created: Rituals are known which create a type of humunculous called a<br> 'fetch' which retrieve formulae and effects from across planes and<br> dimensions.

Most subside on herds of animals, and the few crops which grow<br> in the rocky, dry soil.  The economy is primarily barter through<br> exchange of food and labour.  Whiel they might recognize the coins for<br> foreign lands, gold and silver are of little use here.  A small roster<br> of spirits are honoured, and most Chlendi credit them for their<br> continued survival.<br> <br> Important Cities<br> ----------------<br> Jibido - City of Mindat founded at the point of the Western Peninsula<br> of the Rhiat.  Prison colony built to oversee the exiled priests and<br> sorcerors.  The Mindat feared executing those who possessd great<br> calentures from the old gods. Justicars in the Mindat homeland still<br> receive annual updates from the palace guard, stating that few of the<br> prisoners have died, despite exceeding the normal human lifespan<br> centuries ago.</div></html>|

Trees surrounding the<br> hillside path burst into flame and smoke enveloped the group as<br> bestial "hill people" charged into the line of mourners.  Taking<br> cover, our game warden Rikuu began firing arrows at the advancing<br> beasts, taking a nasty slice to the gut in the process.  Viktor fired<br> his pistol and sliced on the beasts trying to take control of the<br> wagons.  Ever-bold Nisik crawled to a "strategic position" beneath the<br> wagons and set upon chanting arcane prayers to the spirits.  Valiant<br> militiamen fired their rifles in the hordes and tried to hold them off<br> as the nobles and townspeople fled back to town.  The wagon drivers<br> has to axe blows and bizarre spasm-inducing tentacles.  Quickly it<br> became apparent. that the "hill people" had more in mind than just<br> chaos and bloodshed.  They were after the Baron's casket.  After<br> hacking and firing they're way to the front wagon, and downing a few<br> foes, it's discovered that the true beats the Rikuu has grown to hate,<br> but a few dozen bandits in rags and hide masks.  After a few idle<br> threats, the leader reveals that they were hired by a man at the Shell<br> & Cup tavern to disrupt the procession and steal the Baron's corpse<br> without bringing much harm to the nobles.  <br> <br> The band took a few captives and the Baron's corpse to meet Fulwen,<br> the Baron's Majordomo, who was secreted away at the hospital (read<br> 'asylum').  They planned to delay the funeral proceedings by telling<br> the priests that the hill people had run off with the Baron's corpse,<br> so they could keep it for further study.  Fulwen had discovered<br> records that another shipment of the mysterious herbs would be arrived<br> the next day for the Baron, and planned to meet with the merchants<br> involved.  Meanwhile, they would ambush Chivat, the man who hired the<br> bandits for the corpse-napping.  Vanos, the morally-challenged<br> administrator of the asylum seemed all-too-happy to provide a<br> vegetative inmate and a copy of brawny truncheon-wielding "assistants"<br> to aid in the ambush.  They stowed the vegetable in place of the<br> Baron's corpse and headed to the Boneyard.<br> <br> Rikuu took a vantage point among the tombs, as the rest of the group<br> approached the meeting spot, masquerading as bandits in the beast<br> masks.  After negotiations begin to stall, Nisik felled a few thugs<br> which an incantation, Rikuu bulleye's a shot into Chivat's chest. <br> Chivat conjures a heavy fog and retreats, as Viktor and the thugs<br> advance in hopes of capturing the leader.  Viktor subdues him, but not<br> before a thug falls to the ground, his face mangled from an unknown<br> cause.  The other thug panics and flees but is dropped by a wounding<br> pistol shot from Viktor.  They bind the wounds of Chivat, and retreat<br> to the subbasement of the asylum.<br> <br> After some interrogation, Chivat reveals they've been watching the<br> Baron and feared him research into the spirit world.  He and fellow<br> cultists of Mustyoch feared without proper binding rituals, the<br> cremation of the corpse would release fell spirits into the world. <br> Chivat himself is not sure the details of the of Baron's researches,<br> but know he was conducting rituals at a hunting lodge in the hills. <br> Before the Chivat could be questioned further, he began hacking and<br> coughing.  A foot long white worm erupted from his mouth and scuttled<br> along the floor.  After some jumping and smashing the worm was killed<br> and thrown into a jar of preservative fluid.  Chivat passed out, and<br> the group began to formulate further plans.</div></html>|

The Maetah traditionally<br> did not have clans in the sense of Heteri and Chlendi social<br> organization.  They tied ancestry to direct lines, rather than the<br> groups of lineages used by the Heteri and Chlendi.  As they were<br> conquered and assimilated by the Chlendi a few of the practices<br> intermixed.  The Chlendi term for clan, "qod", saw use, though most<br> "clans" were simply lineages of higher status.  In the time of the<br> Chlendi dominated these clans were almost exclusively owners of lands,<br> rather than the lineages of peasants and sersf that worked the lands.<br>  As the Eskla Empire bloomed and time progress, lower class lineages<br> imitated the wealthy and began calling their family or lineage a clan,<br> often creating fictional legends surrounding a founder.  <br> <br> Among wealthy Maetah families, clan markers are in a manner like those<br> of the Clendi and Heteri; the marking of doors, gates and entrances. <br> In this case the form is of a single pillar or obelisk. The pillar is<br> drapped with a banner engraved with runes decsribing the clans role or<br> history.<br> <br> Maetah "clan" sigils are simple drawings of lines, dots, and curves,<br> enclosed by a circle.  The sigils of Maetah sorcerers, leaders,<br> deities, and spirits use similar elements, but are enclosed in a<br> downward pointing triangle.</div></html>|

Rikuu had headed<br> back to his hovel to check on the family, and Irosk & Nisik returned<br> to the local tavern at which they had lodging.  The group would go<br> their separate ways the next day and meet up at dusk.  We began on the<br> 12th of Lilvun, 3042.<br> <br> Nisik had exchanged a few courier messages with Simac, a fellow<br> Chlendi sorcerer from his youth that was in town.  After checking<br> other possible source of esoteric knowledge in town, he sought him out<br> at a Sorcerers' Lodge run by Kabrah in the southern part of town. <br> After being personally greeted by Kabrah, he spoke with Simac, who was<br> still wearing odd black makeup and clothing from a ritual.  Simac told<br> him of conflicts he saw to the north in Nipend and his fear of<br> returning there.  Argaevaligne was attempted to annex the city-state.<br>  He wasn't comfortable in Cuvuaw either, and was worried that Nisik<br> was under surveillance while in town. Nisik asked for his assistance<br> in researching the names "Johud" and "Walker in the Wastes", and Simac<br> agreed to send him word of any findings.<br> <br> Meanwhile, Irosk went to meet with Glaiush of Shattered Hoof Clan,<br> local leader of the Commerce Guild.  He keyed him into some ongoings<br> with local politics that might be of interest to others.  Glaiush was<br> intrigued by the contacts that Irosk had made in just one day, and<br> pleased with the progress of trade and caravanning.  He felt it was in<br> the Guild's best interest to be on good terms with the recently,<br> title, wealthy, and ostensibly eligible Baroness Ilwaen. Most of the<br> other nobles in town owed the wealth and status to Comte or the<br> products of the local mines that for odd historical reasons were under<br> control of the Jeweler's Guild.  The two force were in league, leaving<br> the Commerce Guild out in the cold.  The two discussed a number of<br> plots, including the "swaying" of caravans in hire of the Jewelers'<br> Guild, and the status of the Comte's son, currently in route to Cuvauw.<br> <br> That evening, the pair made two trips to the "hospital".  Stange<br> events were at foot. While approaching the asylum, they were passed at<br> the gate by two riders on horseback, a rare occurrence so late in the<br> evening.  While visiting a suspicious character in the<br> sub-sub-basement, Irosk noted a young boy in purple livery being<br> dragged into a cell.  Upon later reflection, Nisik hypothesized this<br> might be a page of the Sorcerer's Lodge he visited earlier.  The<br> interrogated the suspicious character himself, a mousy man named<br> Paedruun, claims to have killed a pair of "small trolls" out in the<br> woods behind the farmlands, and saw one expunge another of the white<br> worms.  After further "treatment" by Vanos, he admitted to still<br> having the worm.  It was being kept in a "secret spot" out in the woods.  <br> <br> They also headed upstairs to ask Chivat (the Musthyuch priest who had<br> coughed up the white worm) further questions, and check with Fulwen. <br> Opening the locked cell, they found both missing.  The only signs of<br> their disappearance was a shredded piece of rope which once restrained<br> Chivat, and a man-shaped outline of blood upon the wall.  It coursed<br> with magical energy.  Under questioning, Vanos claimed he had seen<br> nothing unusual since they were last checked.<br> <br> Leaving the asylum, Irosk noticed a pair likely thugs tailing them,<br> but lost them through some navigating in the crowds and sidestreets. <br> Returning to their rooms, Nisik found a message waiting from Simac. <br> According to his findings, 'Johud' was a named of Chlendi origin. <br> "The Walker in the Wastes" is a phrase from Mindat mysticism, which<br> refers to the dark side of one's mind, which is the final phase in the<br> process of self-purification.  Simac thought he could find out more,<br> but was suddenly called back to his lodge in Nipend.<br> <br> Nisik & Irosk hoped to catch up with Rikuu and Viktor shortly, and<br> examine the "trolls" as well as farmhouse they had found directions to<br> (in the Baron's hunting shack).  We ended with the characters<br> awakening on Lilvun the 13th, 3042.</div></html>|

Word had been sent to Viktor,<br> but no response.  He had not been seen in two days.  The plan was to<br> investigate the findings of this man (Paedruun) in the "hospital" and<br> then check out the farmhouse they had previously found directions to.<br>  Both were among the fields west of the city.  But first, Rikuu felt<br> it would be valuable to consult a soothsayer about some of the strange<br> findings.  The trio ventured off to the slums in search of Mokush, a<br> Heteri Soothsayer that Rikuu's father suggested.  <br> <br> They found her in a makeshift shackle built from rubble in a slowly<br> collapsing alleyway.  She was making some sort of stew that they could<br> smell a block a way.  Only Rikuu entered. After an initial divination,<br> she proclaimed "I need new bones!" and sent them off in search of a<br> live bird.  The found a fine southern bird, a purple and grey<br> sikoltok, at the market in the old amphitheater.  Returning with the<br> bird, Mokush had it walk towards a crystal, and then gutted the fowl,<br> reading answers from its intestines.  Rikuu kept the bird's head as a<br> momento.  The soothsayer revealed that 'Johud' was the name of a<br> spirit, and could be either friend or foe.  Tbe white worms<br> individually are not a difficult to defeat, but they represent an<br> ancient, greater foe.<br> <br> Not sure what to make of this new knowledge, they headed to the asylum<br> to grab Paedruun.  They ended up "purchasing" him from the asylum<br> master Vanos, who dragged him out of the sub-sub-basement in<br> reasonable condition.  The Baron's body was still tucked away in a<br> cell, and Vanos was a little uneasy about it's continued presence.  He<br> was also anxious to remove the blood drawing up Chivat's old cell, but<br> kept it locked and (still) unoccupied in the interim.  <br> <br> Paedruun stopped at his book-filled hovel to grab his keys and then<br> led the band through the fields to his shack and liquor-still in the<br> woods at the edge of the foothills.  Waiting there were a few thugs,<br> who had been purchasing Paedruun's grain-booze and selling for a tidy<br> profit beneath the watch of the Brewer's Guild.  They were anxious for<br> they're lasted shipment, which was behind due to Paedruun's<br> incarceration.  A show of force scared them off, though the thugs<br> attempted an ill-advised ambush when the group left the woods.  While<br> Paedruun tended to his still, Irosk & Nisik examined the contents of<br> the shack and the condition of the captured white worm, and Rikuu<br> began to dig up the bodies of the "trolls" the worm came from. <br> Expecting hill people, beastmen, or some other humanoid, they were a<br> little surprised to find two children from town lying in the shallow<br> graves.  No evidence of a second worm was seen, and Paedruun<br> maintained that he killed the "trolls" out of self-defense.  Not<br> terribly surprised by the man's psychosis, they left him to his still<br> and headed to the farmhouse.<br> <br> Aside from the ambush, it an uneventful hour's walk through the fields<br> to the farmhouse the directions specified.  Its yard was overgrown and<br> the gate locked.  Noting the Maetah clanmarker at the wall, the<br> climbed over the fence, and headed toward the house.  Before long,<br> Nisik tripped over a dead cow lying in the high weeds.  There was at<br> least a dozen spread out across the field in similar condition.  All<br> without signs of trauma or disease, but dead, and bearing a brand<br> shaped in the sigil of Musthyoch, the Maetah deity of animals, life,<br> and blood, and patron of Chivat, the cultist who had escaped.  Oh<br> yeah, and all the cows were missing their eyes.<br> <br> Uneasy with continued trend of dead people and animals, mutilated or<br> not, the three cautiously approached the farmhouse, which appeared<br> recently abandoned and in ill repair.  A search of the building found<br> little of note, though people not doing much farming had occupied it.<br>  The only point of interest was the basement, revealed through a<br> trapdoor in the pantry. They found evidence and tools of rituals;<br> candles, knives, herbs, and incense.  The center of the room had a<br> large magic circle drawn in blood with a chair in the center, not<br> unlike what was found in the Baron's hunting lodge.  Nisik detected<br> that the circle was still active with the aura of conjuration and<br> abjuration.  Not wanting to meddle further with unknown sorceries,<br> they band headed back for town, returning just after dark.</div></html>|

He had been held<br> under "house arrest" by the priests of Thedine, working with the tacit<br> permission of the Comte.  They questioned him about the circumstances<br> of the Baron's death and surrounding events.  They kept him fed and in<br> good condition, and released him after some sort of internal dissent<br> among the priests.  Some of the nogs questioned were not so lucky.<br> <br> After a night's rest, he caught up with the rest of our troublemakers<br> at their usual breakfast spot.  They relayed accounts of the past few<br> days and exchanged conspiracy theories, mostly Rikuu's.  While the<br> rest sought more information at the asylum, Viktor would head out to<br> find Elle. He initially headed to the Comte's manorhouse, where Elle<br> had be staying during the commotion of the funeral and search for her<br> father's corpse.    Viktor exchanged a few pleasantries with the Comte<br> and learned that during his absence she had returned home.  Despite<br> his suspicions, the Baron seemed genuinely concerned about her welfare<br> and the location of the Baron's body.  The Comte told Viktor he would<br> lead a purge through the hills come spring, intent on wiping out the<br> ever-growing Hill People menace that he blamed for the corpse-knapping.<br> <br> After grabbing some food, Viktor headed the Ilwaen manorhouse.  It<br> seemed largely empty, and the front entrance was barred.  He made his<br> way through the back gate, find a few servants present, but no nogs. <br> He eventually discovered Elle in her bedroom sedated and growing<br> ever-drowsier from the doctor's herbal tonic.<br> <br> Vaguely on route to the Hospital was the townhouse of one the leaders<br> of the Brewer's Guild.  Irosk felt it was his "civic duty" to report<br> the distilling operation they found in the woods.  Only his assistants<br> was available, but took down the vague location and thanked Irosk for<br> his efforts.  The Brewer's Guild while incapable of outlawing liquor<br> production, controlled it's sale in the city and would be grateful to<br> the Commerce Guild for Irosk's initiative.<br> <br> The trio were beginning to feel a little too comfortable at the<br> asylum.  Rikuu went in the crawlspace behind Vanos' "office" to<br> examine the Baron's corpse.  After nearly five days, the Baron's body<br> had not decayed a bit.  Still no breathing or vital signs.  He caught<br> with Irosk and Nisik trying to enter the cell that once held Chivat<br> and Fulwen.  Vanos' had just clubbed one of his assistants to death<br> after seeing him mess with the blood outline on the wall.  The outline<br> appeared to be some sort of portal.  Gutting the assistant body's in<br> case it held a worm, Rikuu ("the Butcher") splattered blood<br> everywhere, including the wall.  They could see the walk grow hazy and<br> indistinct, but fade back to solidity after a minutes.  Enough blood<br> enabled them to activate the portal, with Nisik initially exploring. <br> A few minutes later Irosk and Rikuu followed.  It lead to a rough-hewn<br> stone chamber somewhere below the ground.<br> <br> After some experimental with the portal, Irosk, Nisik and Rikuu headed<br> down the tunnel.  A rough-hewn rock passage led to a branch of the<br> sewer system, like the escape path of Chivat and/or Fulwen.  While<br> wet, smelly, ad filthy, they saw little of interest and no sign of the<br> escaped duo.  With some basic orienteering and following the drain of<br> the water, the trio found their way out to the river, where the sewers<br> drain in the northeast portion of town.  Retreating to their rooms and<br> homes, they cleaned up and met with Viktor at the tavern, again<br> exchanging their finds.  After some more discussion and more of<br> Rikuu's conspiracy theories, they decided to head out and try to<br> question some of the priest of Musthyoch.<br> <br> While heading through the Merchant's Ward to the Temple of Musthyoch,<br> a young man in robes jumped from the crowd, reaching for Rikuu.  The<br> man saw Rikuu as "the one with the wild eyes", sensing some sort of<br> mystical quality about him, and mentioned the word 'Johud'.  Taking<br> the boy aside for interrogation, he revealed his membership in the<br> Cult of the Vaporous Host. The Cult sought out signs of the end of the<br> world, when 'The Old Gods' would return.  A small contingent had<br> crossed referenced the occurrence of "signs" with the holy book, and<br> came to Cuvauw looking for the next set of signs.  While Rikuu was a<br> bit concerned, Nisik couldn't decide if the guy was (another) loony,<br> or if he was just pissed that he wasn't chosen as some sort of prophet.<br> <br> From there, they headed through the alleys to the Court of the<br> Northern Gods, where temple and shrines to the Maetah pantheon stood.</div></html>|

Each follows similar form, lining the sides of the<br> street, with the largest at the end.  Each shrine is built upon a 6' -<br> 8' high cut stone "plaza", with a central 8'-10' wide staircase<br> leading up from the street.  At the foot of each staircase is a statue<br> depicting the god.  All the statues are cut from the same stone in<br> similar style, unclothed, standing straight up and with few features.<br>  The temple and shrines themselves are one to three stories, mostly of<br> timbered mudbrick.  The roofs fan out in pagoda style with each story,<br> and are covered in slate tiles of natural colours.<br> <br> The shrines are laid out in the following order, starting on the left<br> side of the lane, following the cul-de-sac to the right side: Thedine,<br> Hilinavyu, Ubo, Eluus, Musthyoch, Lob, Storm Mother, Uzhidhomi.<br> <br> Notes on individual shrines<br> <br> Thedine: The small shrine of Thedine is locked, barred, and its statue<br> draped in black.<br> <br> Hilinavyu: The shrine is built of rough hewn rock, unlike the others,<br> with two fire pits out front burning day and night.  The statue is<br> blank, with two eyes, rimmed in black. Two stories tall.<br> <br> Ubo: The shrine of Ubo had no door, but an entrance draped with furs<br> of grey and white.  It is two stories tall and conical, unlike the<br> others. The statue has its eyes shut.<br> <br> Eluus: Largest of the shrines, it is three stories tall. The status is<br> the standard of the avenue, simple and without decor.<br> <br> Musthyoch: Also three stories the shrine of Musthyoch stands next to<br> that of Eluss.

Nearing the Baron's<br> old hunting lodge, a pack of hill people dropped down from the trees in<br> ambush.  Rikuu ducked back to fire some arrows, while Nisik chanted some<br> incantations and summoned forth some lunar hounds.  Viktor fired off his<br> pistol, shocked to see how resilient the furred, horned beasts were.  He<br> took it down, but not before being badly gored by it's horns.  Irosk<br> climbed up from the ground and began attacking the one that jumped him.<br> He was even more badly hurt and blows from horns and blades, and was<br> barely able to stand.  Viktor was able to take down that foe as well,<br> while another of Nisik spells caused the two final beasts to fight among<br> themselves and run off through the woods.  Nearing midnight and badly<br> hurt, they bound their wounds and headed to the lodge.<br> <br> Arriving the hunting lodge, they found the building had been searched,<br> but nothing missing. Out front were the ravaged remains of a few horses.<br> Later, Rikuu would find the corpses of their riders' out in the woods,<br> also mangles and partially eaten.  The set up watch and rested for the<br> evening.  Just before dawn, the remaining two hill people returned<br> killing Rikuu's horse before they could be dispatched.  The Heteri said<br> a prayer to Utan for the horse, and their retired for further rest.<br> That night Nisik had a dream of Johud. They relaxed and healed up on the<br> 15th, and head up into the hills the following morning, the chair<br> strapped to Nisik's mule.<br> <br> It was early afternoon when the reaching Yellow Banner Peak, a craggy<br> outcropping and a small level area and some caves.  A pair of nogs had<br> been buried there, with grave markings in the style of the Chlendi.<br> Ever the grave robbers, the little corpses were disinterred and<br> examined, apparently dying from starvation.  In one of the caves was<br> evidence of some sort of ritual, with a number of rocks of amberite left<br> behind.  The other cave showed signs of mining, and had tunnels reaching<br> further back into the hill. Lighting torch and lantern, they march in,<br> stopping to examine a trail of dried slime entering a side-cave. In the<br> cave they found more evidence of ritual proceedings.  Drawing upon the<br> walls and floor, spent candles, astrological calculations. More mention<br> of the Walker in the Wastes, written in Mindat.<br> <br> Before they could explore further, the source of the slime trail<br> approaches from the tunnel.  It's a large slug-like creature, who<br> mistakes Rikuu for his father (Rikuu's father, not the slug) and knew<br> the Baron in the past.  He has no names, but refers to himself as an<br> "ontomo", and has dwelled within the caverns for many years.  He had no<br> knowledge of Johud or the rituals taking place in the caverns. The<br> ontomo did see a few Mindat riding lizards, which corroborated some of<br> the tracks seen outside caverns.</div></html>|

Many tribes and city-states forged alliances and intermarried<br> as a response to the growing power of the newly arrived Chlendi in the <br> north, and the spread of Mindat culture to the south.  The Golden<br> Empire encompassed the southern Minkush River Valley, (now) Balaconth,<br> and Vennosat at its height.<br> <br> Bogog, a Heteri chief of the Naggai tribe, ruled the burgeoning<br> city-state of Akklai in (what is now) southern Balaconth.  He married<br> the daughters of the chiefs ruling Ven-no-sat and Minkushtown, and<br> allied with the Vuhwuls of Cuvauw, Vhaemuth, and border towns to the<br> east, united them under his banner.  The alliance lasted for nearly<br> 200 years, as he fought Sofegai and rival chiefs to the west, and<br> stabilize relations with the Chlendi to the north.  He supported the<br> Chlendi during the onset of the Black Pox, beginning a relationship<br> that would prove the Empire downfall.  Needing allying against rival<br> Heteri chiefs and the encroaching Mindat, the Golden Empire allied<br> with Chlendi clans, who saw a strong southern neighbor in their<br> conquest of the Maetah.<br> <br> The Heteri of the Golden Kingdom were wise enough not to trust all the<br> clans under the Black Lily Crown and sough console with the Maetah<br> clans, and met up a peak in hills north of Cuvauw, between the lands<br> of both peoples. Fearing collusion, the Chlendi spied upon their<br> allies, when the time came forth, empyreal beings of shadow and mist<br> rose forth from the caverns below, slaying all at the meeting.  All<br> that remained was the yellow banner of the Golden Empire.</div></html>|

Like dewdrops forming on a leaf, the semi-conscious<br> bits of matter coalesced into forms, one of which we now call Thedine.<br>  The other semiconscious entities where content with the chaotic sea<br> of matter, but Thedine invested himself in this sea, tilling and<br> planting with his soul and consciousness, until the sweat and blood of<br> his efforts formed Uod and other lands.  The other entities saw this<br> creation and mimicked it, but brought forth shallow devices with the<br> dedication and toil of Thedine.  Thedine saw them and pitied them, and<br> as an example created mankind upon Uod, and gave them freewill, so<br> that all beings could see how anyone possessed of conviction and<br> dedication could make meaningful creations.  The other spirits toiled<br> again, some giving greater effort, creating beasts and winds and<br> trees, but none could survive with out the gifts provided with<br> investiture of Thedine.

The farthest incursion of the Mindat into the Empire. They<br> laid seige upon the city for a year and a moon.  The Mindat brought in<br> a circle of sorcerers to bring down the city walls. Despite the<br> Chlendi magicks, plague and starvation had set in, yet the city had<br> not fallen.  In the midst of the riots, the imperial family had<br> retreated to the palace, using fell magicks to secure the building. <br> The Mindat ritual crushed the city walls, leveling the city and<br> killing most of the inhabitants.

Just to take a few issues that I might toss you,<br> if I were your referee and were "going by the book":<br> <br> In the original EPT, foreigners come into Jakalla Harbour as complete<br> innocents. They have no backgrounds, no jobs, very little money or<br> items that they can turn into gold; they do not speak the language and<br> have to spend months (real time as well as game time) learning enough<br> Tsolyani so that they are not killed by the first noble Tsolyani who<br> takes offense at their barbarous pronunciation, brutish ways, and<br> ridiculous costumes. They must stay inside the walls of the<br> Foreigners' Quarter -- to go out is certain death at the hands of the<br> city guards until they learn enough of the language and society to<br> meet a patron and hold a menial job. There are no restaurants where<br> foreigners can buy food. (The clans take care of this and do not sell<br> to foreigners, unless they have the patronage of one of the other<br> recognised nations of Tekumel, or are in the company of Tsolyani.)<br> There are no bars or taverns: to mingle with persons of other status<br> levels -- too high for you and too low for them -- is ignoble and a<br> sure challenge to a duel, or straight on to imprisonment snd death.<br> There are no hotels except some very, very low hostels that no<br> self-respecting Tsolyani would ever visit. Foreigners cannot walk<br> about a Tsolyani city and look for a job or an apartment! Foreigners<br> cannot enter or leave a city without papers. Foreigners cannot even<br> approach a high-class Tsolyani without fear of insulting him by their<br> presence and uncouth language or accent -- which will certainly lead<br> to imprisonment, slavery, and/or death. Foreigners cannot enter a<br> Tsolyani temple without polluting it and thus getting arrested and<br> executed. A foreigner or two can perhaps be magically transferred to<br> Tekumel and dropped off in a wilderness or jungle far from a city.<br> Hunting would then be their sole means of finding food -- no villager<br> would dare to feed a foreigner! A large party of foreigners, such as<br> you envisage, would draw attention -- and the constabulary, who would<br> then be obliged to slaughter the lot of them since they cannot speak<br> Tsolyani and have no identity documents. Nor can the party hide for<br> long; it is too big and too unfamiliar with Tekumelani culture as well<br> as the vegetation, dangerous animals, etc.<br> <br> Carrying large amounts of iron or steel would entice any Tekumelani<br> thief, and the temples, the government, etc. would probably simply<br> confiscate the foreigners' supply, kill them to keep them quiet, and<br> be done with it!<br> <br> The pretty girl you mentioned would instantly be snapped up and sold<br> as a slave. If she had an entourage of friends and defenders, they<br> would be slaughtered, and she would then either be enslaved or killed.<br> A lone beauty is just money in the bank to the slavers' clans. At<br> best, if she did find a patron, he would not want to protect her<br> because he could earn more by selling her -- if he tried to keep her<br> for himself, he would risk other people trying to take her away for<br> themselves. Being sold to a devotee of Lady Hrihayal or Dlamelish<br> would be extremely unpleasant for an "independent" (= "modern"-- read<br> "feminist" American or European girl! A foreign woman cannot gain<br> "Aridani" (legally independent) status unless she is a ciizen, able to<br> speak Tsolyani, and fluent in the culture.<br> <br> Terran magic does not work on Tekumel -- our sorcery is based on<br> principles that do not function there. Tekumelani magic works by<br> drawing power out of the Planes Beyond, then moulding and shaping it<br> with spells that no foreigner could know without years of study (to<br> which he/she can never gain access!) Your "sun" and "moon" magic<br> cannot function; they are based upon the Terran sun abd moon, which<br> are many, many light years distant -- too far away for their powers to<br> travel. Tekumel's sun and its two moons are simply astronomical bodies<br> and have no magical powers of their own.<br> <br> The Tsolyani language is a major obstacle. It is not very difficult,<br> but it is necessary to learn not only grammar and phonetics but also<br> such cultural items as the many forms of "you," etc. A foreigner needs<br> much exposure to the culture to be sure of not offending a high-clan<br> Tsolyani. The little golden "universal translator globes" proposed by<br> Bob Alberti are too rare and costly to be a solution -- where is your<br> large party going to come upon such a huge hoard of these devices?<br> Even if you do, they only translate human spoken languages and do not<br> impart reading or writing.<br> <br> Tsolyanu is just as difficult as mediaeval Hindu India or pre-European<br> Japan. The only way a foreigner can survive in Tsolyani society is to<br> enter Tsolyanu at a recognised entry-port, take a menial job, and work<br> his/her way up. ...Slowly. Other nations -- Mu'ugalavya, Yan Kor,<br> Salarvya, etc. have their own peculiar problems, too! Put your party<br> down in a distant jungle, and there are dangerous animals, poisonous<br> vegetation, nutritional differences between the local foods and Terran<br> fare -- etc. Survival on a rock sticking up out of the southern ocean<br> might work -- but such a life would be lonely, like Robinson Crusoe.<br> Even so, if a shipload of Hokun from Benre Sa or a Hluss vessel<br> chanced upon the place, then there would be mayhem and an end to the<br> adventure, one way or the other.<br> <br> You may ask: how do new players get onto Tekumel at all? Either as<br> barbarians (see above) or as *native Tsolyani.* The last player in our<br> group who got in *the hard way" is the esteemed Arumel hiChankolel,<br> who finally worked his way up to adoption by a good clan, a fine<br> marriage, and acceptance even in the halls of Avanthar.  All of the<br> rest of our new players (for the past twenty-five years or<br> thereabouts) have started out as *native* Tsolyani. They have been of<br> various social levels, but they always have had enough knowledge of<br> the culture to survive without outside aid. Every new player is given<br> a persona, including a clan, a religions sect, a knowledge of the<br> language (often more than one), fluency in the society, etc. etc. We<br> do this either by rolling dice against a series of tables, or the<br> referee (me) picks a persona that fits the scenario (e.g. a sailor<br> aboard a ship that is transporting the party). Much of what I have<br> said above then no longer applies, and the party can enjoy the game.<br> <br> I urge you to set up a Tsolyani party, cancel (temporarily, until<br> their jaunt on Tekumel is finished) all of the non-Tekumelani magic,<br> appearances, gadgets, etc. that would make your people stand out as<br> aliens. Instead of trying to disguise themselves and avoid the<br> problems described above, help them to fit in and cooperate in the<br> world which they are visiting.<br> <br> It's either this or else modify Tekumel beyond recognition. Do as you<br> see fit.<br> <br> <br> > The ritual the characters use is based on a pentagram enclosing the <br> rift<br> > they wish to close.

Does this mean that a demon can just walk<br> around in<br> > a city? [Not at all. Demons are not acceptable in cities, any more<br> than they are here.]<br> > <br> > 7) As to magic problems mentioned by Andy, my general thought is <br> that<br> > Tekumel magic works its way and the characters magic works their<br> way. [And Terran magic doesn't work on Tekumel because it is based on<br> completely different principles.]<br> <br> This<br> > leaves 2 problems.

Your vampires would fry like eggs on a New York summer<br> sidewalk when the sun comes up! I am afraid your vampires would be<br> almost defenseless against Tekumelani magic.<br> > <br> > 8) Some character are multi-lingual and some are familiar with<br> non-Western<br> > cultures, this might help in the regard that they are less likely to<br> make<br> > assumptions. [This might help, true, but the Tsolyani are not<br> familiar with non-Tekumelani cultures and mores. It is *their*<br> assumptions you have to worry about. As I say, you'll be happier with<br> native Tsolyani characters.

They eventually all enter<br> the circle.<br> <br> - They "awake" in a clearing in the grasslands, underneath a purple<br> sky.  To the "west" is hills, to the "east" a forest, though they're<br> not sure of the time, place, and actual directions.<br> <br> - They are stealthily approached by Ikar and a pair of fellow<br> "Zhammi", 10' tall, eight-limbed beasts, who walk on four legs, with<br> horns, sporadic clothing, and smooth blue-gray skin.  The Zhammi slice<br> at the group, removing a think yellow membrane (the "caul")from them,<br> after which everything seems to look much clearer.<br> <br> - The Zhammi are friendly, offering drink and telling them of their<br> surroundings, but can answer little about where they really are, and<br> know nothing of Uod or the Rhiat.  They do know of Johud and the<br> "Walker  in the Wastes", whom rule areas to the "north" and the<br> "south".  They offer to lead them to the city in the south, "Zoit".<br> <br> - Zoit has huge walls and towers, and is built of adobe and mudbrick.<br>  The Zhammi lead them through the market, which is filled with people<br> of various colours and shapes, and some of which seem vaguely human. <br> After a few beverages, it becomes apparent that the group is to be<br> sold as slaves.  Before the transaction could be completed, or<br> violence breaks out, the group is "bought" by a hooded figure,<br> comprised of whispy black vapours, who then leads them away to a cafe.<br> <br> - This figure turns out to be the Baron, and much is revealed.  He is<br> not dead, but hiding in this "dream realm".  His meat body is not<br> well, and is preparing to exist permanently in this realm, which he<br> has been visiting for many years.  His current situation is<br> inadvertant, and will soon return to Uod when the astrological timing<br> is proper.  But he fears for the group, who has not entered properly<br> and must leave soon or face danger.  He suggests they hide (bury) his<br> "corpse" and bids them away.<br> <br> Other notes:<br> - The Baron knows little of the White Worms.<br> - Johud rules The City Across the River, and is *not* a friend, and<br> seeks power within Uod.<br> - He doesn't like or trust the followers of Thedine, Musthyoch or the<br> Comte, but none are directly involved to his knowledge.<br> <br> Comments?

Not the same as the OA one I<br> referred to, but very close:<br> <br> Commune With Lesser Spirit (Divination)<br> Sphere: Necromantic<br> Range: 10 feet<br> Components: V, S, M<br> Duration: Special<br> Casting Time: 1 turn<br> Area of Effect: Special<br> Saving Throw: None<br>  By use of the commune with lesser spirit spell, the priest is able to <br> contact any of the hundreds of local spirits which dwell in the land.<br> Local <br> spirits are those with limited powers and range, the spirits of a<br> particular <br> tree, rock, or stream are typical lesser nature spirits.  A spirit that<br> haunts a <br> single building or compound could also be contacted.  To contact the<br> spirit, <br> the priest must know its identity and must be within 10 feet of the area<br> <br> where the spirit is found.<br>  Once the spirit is contacted, the priest can ask it one question for <br> every level of experience he has gained.  The questions must be specific<br> and <br> clearly worded, but are not limited to yes or no answers.  The spirit<br> answers <br> questions literally and does not volunteer any information.  The answers<br> are <br> always correct if the answer is known.  The types of answers given will <br> depend on the nature of the spirit that is being questioned.<br>  The spirit can only answer those questions concerning the <br> immediate area it affects.  Questions beyond the scope of the spirit are<br> <br> wasted.  The use of this spell is limited to once per week for any given<br> spirit <br> in a particular area.  If a second casting of this spell is performed by<br> the <br> same priest before a week is out, the spell fails.  However, a different<br> priest <br> could contact the same spirit during the one week period.<br>  The material components of this spell are incense and an offering <br> appropriate to the nature of the spirit.</div></html>|

I've been trying to cobble thing<br> together during this "break". So far little luck with linguistics.<br> -------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> Utan the Destroyer, Patriarch of the Heteri Pantheon, and God of<br> Warfare, Power, and Death.<br> ---------------------------------<br> <br> "A Feast to my enemies!"<br> <br> Utan is a God to the Gods.  He destoyed the Old Gods, freeing the<br> Heteri people, giving birth to the rest of the pantheon. All the other<br> gods are considered his slaves.  Legend has it that Utan was the first<br> chief of the Heteri people and slew the elder gods, gaining<br> immortality by feasting on their blood and flesh.  He raised up his<br> brothers and sisters, chiefs of the Heteri tribes to rule along side<br> him as gods.He learned the secrets of warfare, herding and animal<br> husbandry and taught them to the Heteri people.<br> <br> In honour of this event, the day of spring, Heteri communities hold a<br> great feast in Utans honour, sacrificing a capture enemy warrior in a<br> funeral pyre.  But first, his blood is drained and mixed in casks of<br> ale and wine for all to drink.<br> <br> There are no true temples or priests of Utan.  The Heteri people<br> recognize his as the greatest of gods, but realize he cares little for<br> them.  All priests of the Heteri pantheon honour him foremost, through<br> the patronage of the pantheon.  In the entranceway of every Heteri<br> temple is a statue to Utan, and another towers over the later in the<br> sanctum sactorum.<br> <br> Utan cares not for your prayers.  He is busy keeping the heavens<br> upheld from the earth.  Honour your clans and your Vuhwul, and you<br> honour Utan.  You say no prayers to Utan, but still call out his<br> names.  You pray "to Kos, for Utan's Blessing", when you are lost and<br> the steppes and starving for food.  You pray "to Jotesh, in Utan's<br> name", when you acquire a new horse.<br> <br> Utan reads the signs of the storms as laid out by Lihoe, and from here<br> sees the fortunes of man.  Upon death each man goes before Utan, to<br> acribe value to his life.  Lihoe pleads your case to Utan, and if you<br> have lived an honourable life, you will dwell forever in Utan's grassy<br> plains, sleeping under the stars and the warm sun, riding and hunting<br> beast for food and sport.</div></html>|

The nobility may choose<br> to wear styles they prefer, and the Church of Thedine has its own<br> ritula garb.  Hoods, often lines with furs, are the typical hearwear<br> among the lowerclasses. Helms are only allowed when blade is worn on<br> belt.  There are ornate style of hair braiding, and beads and other<br> jewelry are often woven in.<br> <br> Modern fashions have evolved from the Mindat "bowler style".  In the<br> south, many Heteri have taken to wearing a wide, flatbrimmed version<br> to shield from the sun.  Along the coast, this same style is worn, in<br> fancier materials, with the brim pinned up in the front or sides.  The<br> height of fashion is now in Ven-no-sat, and the Minkush River Valley<br> cities, where nobles and fops try to outdo each other with ornate,<br> uncomfortable hats of expensive materials, lace trim, and rare<br> feathers and embelishments.</div></html>|

You were probably<br> birthed in the home of your biological mother or the building of a<br> midwife or physician.  You do not know who you biological father is.  <br> - You live in a small hut or house (materials depend on the local<br> climate), with a kitchen, common room, communal sleeping chamber, and<br> another room for your mentors (if your sept has enough wealth). You<br> all sleep in hammocks or cots in a single room.<br> - You are monitored by a pair of mentors, are replaced ever year or<br> two.  The teach you, keep you fed, and show you how to interact with<br> others in the community.<br> - Your sept probably has a nog or two to help with cooking and<br> cleaning.  If your sept is wealthy or of high class, you may have a<br> Heteri slave, or even a Bantanog for tending the field, protection or<br> other menial labor.<br> - You may take on many sexual partners during your life, though many<br> people have sequential exclusively relationships.  It is common for<br> partners to be be found among members of your sept.  Any children you<br> father will be raised in a sept with other children of a similar caste<br> born that year.<br> <br> Language<br> --------<br> - You certainly know Mindat, and you are likely fluent in Heteri if<br> you were raised in the north, or come from a well off sept.<br> - You probably speak a bit of Ven-no-sat or even North Common, unless<br> you're from a labor caste sept.<br> <br> Employment<br> ----------<br> - You have little choice.  You can always desert your sept and leave<br> Mindat lands, but your return will means a lifetime of field labor at<br> best.<br> - The caste of your sept largely determines what sort of "career"<br> you'll be apprenticed into.  You teachers believe proper work and<br> meditation can provide almost anyone with the necessary skills for a<br> task.  Provided you've been born into the right caste.<br> - If you exhibit special talents, particularly of a mystical bent, you<br> may be removed from yoru sept before puberty.  This is quite an<br> honour, but your normally be taken to a new sept far away, and your<br> will always miss your former septmates.<br> <br> Religion<br> --------<br> - No one really discusses religion.  You hear stories of the "Old<br> Gods" as a child, and they seem like crazy stories.  <br> - Various schools of natural philosophy have different explanations<br> for the movement of the stars, the winds, and "supernatural" phenomena<br> that other cultures attribute to gods, spirits, and the like.  If you<br> are of an academic bent, you probably lean towards one or more theories.</div></html>|

There seem to be two schools of thought<br> about how to do this in d20. The system used in Star<br> Wars and I think Spycraft is extra dice.

For the warriors<br> it's any six skills + craft.

I'm thinking more along the lines of the hobgoblins in<br> the Kalamar setting, or maybe the Klingons.  Another way of looking at it<br> might be a more Middle Eastern/Indian notion of honor, or perhaps popular<br> notions of the Mafia.  Personal honor as a reflection of clan and family<br> honor.<br> <br> 	Sort of rambling here: Rikuu wouldn't steal from a clan member, or outright<br> lie to someone he has sword allegiance to; in the position of a clan chief<br> or whatnot.  That would be the Baron, others of the Fouled Water Clan etc.<br> Even when it comes to his father, Rikuu has lied by omission rather than<br> making stuff up. The Knights are a gray zone, but as a band bound by common<br> purpose and bonded through combat, they count as "clan" for purposes of<br> honorable behavior; Irosk more so that Nisik and Viktor, as he is heteri.<br> Others are fair game and not deserving of that level of codified behavior,<br> though heteri would be given some level of respect.<br> 	Avenging personal slights in not a matter of honor to him, in the sense of<br> no insult going unpunished.  Major indignities are worthy of retribution.<br> Ikar tops the list, as he sold us into slavery.  Taking revenge on Chivat or<br> the priests of Thedine has no honor component to it, however.<br> <br> 	In combat poison would be out of character for him, as it isn't cricket to<br> his way of thinking, but he would not hesitate to attack infantrymen from<br> horseback, set an ambush, attack an unarmed opponent with a weapon, or gouge<br> eyes and give a swift kick to the nuts in a brawl.

So it's easy to get <br> knocked out, but a little harder to die unless you're alone.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Given these two options Damage reduction sounds like a better option<br> > if you want to change the existing AC options.

AC is Dex<br> + Class bonus, so its low (generally 4-6ish) so most<br> attacks hit. Defender then can choose to Dodge or<br> Block. If they Dodge and get hit armor provides DR of<br> 1-6. If they Block and succeed then they add their<br> shield DR and their armor DR (total is ususally 2-11).<br> So a warrior in full metal armor with a good shield is<br> a tough, tough opponent. Hence the combat system adds<br> in called shot rules which allow you to take penalties<br> to hit in order to reduce or negate the armor.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br> > - Injury levels.

Each<br> character has a Shock value of 1/2 Con. Anytime they<br> take damage equal to or greater then their Shock Value<br> they have to make a Fort save DC 15 or passout for as<br> many rounds as they fail the save. Also they take a<br> Critical Injury which gives them a -1 to actions and<br> they bleed 1 pt/minute until they get some first aid.<br> <br> I've only played with it in a couple of combats, and<br> it adds some bookkeeping for the DM, but I think it<br> models injury and damage much more "realistically". So<br> it'll be a crappy system when I run MegaDungeon 5000.<br> <br> __________________________________<br> Do you Yahoo!?<br> Yahoo!

Once you approach the gates of Bolog, you realize you are<br> still high up in the hills.  Ahead, bonfires gleam on the hilltops in<br> and surrounding the town.  As you approach, the firepits become more<br> evident, on top of hills and ridges both in and outside the city<br> walls, and upon the walls, towers, and high structures that make up<br> Bolog.  The largest of the bonfires are a pair marking the<br> fortress-monastery of Hilivanyu, which towers over the north end of<br> the city, set into the city wall and hillside itself.<br> <br> View of the Gate<br> <br> Whereas Cuvauw's wall showed evidence of grandeur and fine<br> construction beneath their years of poor maintenance, Bolog's defenses<br> almost blend into the countryside in the limited light.  Thick<br> fieldstone walls buttress rock outcroppings, large boulders, and hunks<br> of slag from the smelting furnaces.  In places molten iron appears to<br> have been pour over weak points in the structure, and continually<br> added to.  Anyone with a clue to engineering would have to be crazed<br> to attempt to tunneling through.  Wood and stone parapets dot the wall<br> top, manned with archers and siege weaponry.  The intended target of<br> the defense seems obvious; the wall is top with stakes bearing the<br> skulls and rotting heads of goblins.  Chunks of weaponry, bone, wood<br> and metal debris line the road, and the presence of scavenger birds<br> and vermin can attest to its age.  A few of the older corpses<br> smoldering on the rotting corpse of a great lizard beast by the path<br> to the gate.<br> <br> The main 'gatehouse' is built into walls themselves, barely<br> distinguishable aside from the gate itself.  Portcullises are on<br> either end, with heavy wooden doors on the town interior side.  Past<br> dusk, the portcullis is closed, and visitors must seek entry from the<br> guard.</div></html>|

The traditional prayercloth is tied as a sash at the<br> waist, hung across the shoulders for more formal occasions, and<br> sometimes tied from a saddle or spear when on horseback.  It will<br> contain the symbol of Utan and other gods, and sometimes the glyph of<br> the person's clan.  More decorative versions will have an actually<br> prayer stitched into the cloth.  <br> <br> The other style is genealogical.  Most Heteri are illiterate, but<br> recognize a few letters and glyphs.  Virtually all know the symbols of<br> local clans.  'Clan cloths' are used in the teaching of one's<br> ancestry.  The cloths themselves are a heavy cotton or wool, with<br> symbols and glyphs stitched in.  Children learn the symbol of the<br> their clan is which is added at the top.  As they learn their<br> ancestry, more names (often in symbolic form) are added.  Since this<br> can get very long, often only the clan founder, and the person's most<br> recent ancestors are listed.  Most families will have one or more<br> prayercloths detailing the whole lineage, or as much as is known. <br> Upon maturity (age 13 for males), young adults add their own name to<br> the end of the prayer cloth.  Often a grandmother will create a copy<br> of the prayercloth and mount it upon leather, so it can be hung from a<br> bridle or saddle.</div></html>|

He has a true name, but it is the one piece of lore he<br> shares with no one.  This invocation calls forth the Sovereign Prince<br> to fill one's consciousness and aid in the learning of sorcery.  The<br> invocation takes 4 hours during the proper astrological alignment and<br> requires offerings of incense, blood, and flower petals.  During the<br> ritual, the sorcerer speaks aloud in a variety of tongues, most of<br> dead langauges, writhes upon the floor, and his eyes roll back and are<br> glazed in yellow. The sorcerer will then have the ability to impart<br> one spell into his personal collection, but at price of unhealing<br> wounds that last for one or more days.  The invocation can not be<br> reattempted until previous wounds have healed.<br> <br> Mechanics:<br> The incense and ritual material required for the invocation cost 10<br> gold (in raw currency).  To complete the invocation, the caster must<br> make a Concentration check (DC=12+spell level).  If this is failed,<br> nothing is learned, and the ritual materials are wasted.  The blood<br> sacrifice results in a wound of d6 points per level of spell learned.<br> This wound will not heal, short of a Wish spell, for one day per level<br> of spell earned.  No further costs or time are necessary to learn and<br> transcribe the spell.</div></html>|

It has a<br> heavy curve or hook at the tip, and can be used either one or two handed.<br> <br> - The main Heteri tribes: Naggai, Luggai, Polog.  There are three or<br> four minor tribes.  Each tribe is made up of dozens of clans.  Naggai<br> are the clans of the south (which includes Irosk's).  Luggai are the<br> clans of the west (which includes Rikuu's).<br> <br> - The traditional Heteri failware: "a blessing upon your horse", to<br> which the proper response is: "and upon yours".<br> <br> A few people:<br> - Bajeron: Viktor's contacct in the Order of the Velvet Glove.<br> - Seibaisle - head of the Rais-Worm Lodge in Bolog<br> - Tybyar - Viktor's favourite pimp<br> - Windswept Mane - the Heteri clan that own's your lodging.<br> <br> - On the last handout, I listed "Kultanajhas" as the tutor of the<br> Comte's son.  Ignore that.  The name is linguistically wrong for the<br> teacher.  It will be corrected on the next handout (probably for when<br> you return to Cuvauw), but the name "Kultanajhas" may come up in the<br> next session and I want to avoid confusion.<br> <br> - Another name for your notes "Melaikayin".

The town is ugly like the industrial sector of Cuvauw is<br> ugly, but without the saving grace of being nicer at night.

I'm sure Nisik would at least give the colours<br> pretentious names:  "No, my boots are not black, they are 'ebony not<br> unlike the polished soulstones of the Lurker's deepest reaches'", and<br> "Technically, that robe is 'herring red'".</div></html>|

It was with great excitement that I read<br> your recent letter, though I can't for the life of me<br> figure out why, so many years later, you'd want me to<br> recount the events of our return to Cuvauw after<br> Bolog. However I am happy to comply. Also,<br> congratulations on yet another new child! You and Asa<br> must be very happy. Or at any rate she is very<br> fertile.<br> <br> We returned to Cuvauw at the very end of the month.<br> The wind blew cold and the sun shone colder. We<br> immediately made for the Commerce Guild where we were<br> greeted warmly. Father and Son were reunited and we<br> were asked to return in the morning for our just<br> desserts. I excused myself to return to Elle and the<br> Manor, and I believe Riku returned home, Irosk stayed<br> at the Guild and you took a room at the Earl's Dead<br> Fish with your new nog servant Mr. Whats his name. <br> <br> In the morning Riku, Irosk and I met back at the Guild<br> (you had remained in your room to continue some arcane<br> study) where we were again greeted warmly. After some<br> small talk Gliush presented us with a great mound of<br> gold bars (valued at about 500 gold coins for each of<br> us), and some fancy fur cape like shawl type things.<br> And good booze. One thing about Gliush, he was always<br> generous with the good booze. The mark of a gentleman,<br> I have always said. I always could tell the Conte was<br> a piece of crap based on how stingy he was with his<br> booze. But he got his, didn't he! Har!<br> <br> Anyway, we collected a small portion of our booty and<br> made arrangements for the Commerce Guild to keep the<br> rest for us in a bankerly sense. Then we went to see<br> Vanos. Riku was always worried about Vanos betraying<br> us if we didn't keep him fat and happy. And look how<br> that turned out. Bastard. Anyway, Vanos had hired some<br> replacement guards who were pretty sloppy, and had<br> reinforced his office after his last encounter with<br> the folks not buried in my root cellar. Sounded like<br> not much had been going on in our absence from town,<br> and Vanos didn't know much of use about the ghoul<br> cults were had recently learned about. Ah, the good<br> old days of blissful ignorance and stupidity, eh? <br> <br> I, with the help of Riku and Irosk, broached the idea<br> of bringing a pit fighting franchise to Cuvauw and<br> hosting it at the Asylum with Vanos as the manager. He<br> liked the idea and we made some plans to have Riku's<br> seer go over the place, and to start to tidy it up to<br> host the fights. Vanos was a little worried that some<br> of his higher class clientele might be bothered by the<br> attention, but we were confident we could get around<br> that small problem.<br> <br> That's pretty much all that happened in those first<br> days back.

But no mithril or adamantium per se.  Simply because I<br> want to come up with something of my own.  There are alchemical<br> processes to address the qualities of normally mundane materials.  Lots<br> of ideas, but not a whole lot figured out.  Bits one could stumble upon,<br> but aren't widely known.  Rather carefully guarded secrets by a noble<br> family with alchemists in their employ.  Nothing you'd find plentiful<br> enough to outfit an army.<br> <br> There is, however, what's referred to as "white steel" made from ores<br> mined in the hills surrounding Jakinta (in the far southeast, just north<br> of the Mindat homeland), which is said to be as strong as fine steel,<br> but much lighter.<br> <br> You can consider those Heteri broadswords (that Glaiush gave you)<br> masterwork, in case I didn't mention it.</div></html>|

No death,<br> disease, or want.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 6) Who were the Old Lords Utan conquered?  Are their cults <br> > still around?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Most of them are specifically described.  It's part of the creation<br> myth. Jotesh (Utan's father) is one of the old gods.  One or two others<br> may still be around, depending on what Shaman you talk to.  <br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 7) Does Heter exist in ruins now, like Babylon or Angor Wat <br> > in our world, or in a mythological sense, like Atlantis?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Mythological sense.  It would be in the mountains north or east of<br> Bolog, but considering the time scale, it might not be more than a<br> village if it did exist.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 8) The Mindat are know to have slain their gods, but has any <br> > mortal ever ascended to godhood?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>They don't really think in terms of godhood anymore.  They do talk about<br> "ascension", though that's not necessarily the right word.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 9)  Is there thought to be a source for magic in the world, <br> > or is it just accepted as the way the world works by common <br> > people, like gravity?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>There's a couple sources.  It's a pretty big question.  Traditional<br> Maetah sorcery sees "omnessence" in natural and material items that was<br> infused with the energy of one of their gods.  The Chlendi see energy in<br> the spirits and the stars.  Most Mindat would answer that it's untapped<br> power within oneself.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 10) Do the Heteri have any customs concerning hospitality to <br> > ones enemies?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Yup.  If you *invite* someone into your camp/home you are obligated to<br> feed them and their horses to the best of your ability, and provide a<br> seat at your fire.  Notice that Glaiush always gave you booze when you<br> came by.  They are "considered" a member of your clan while in your<br> care.<br> <br> ------<br> <br> Again, these are the quick answers.  I'm printing all these out so I can<br> more deeply address the others.

What is the color pallette gneerally used for Chlendi clothes?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Dark shades.  Indigo, mossy greens, and browns.  Bright colours attract<br> insects. Blue and purple are the signs of wealth or status.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2.)  Do Hetari use silverware at their meals?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Nope.  Just a knife.  In modern times some of the more cosmopolitan<br> nobles have though.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3.)  Is there a hiearchy of preferable horse colors in Hetari society?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Not particularly.  They know their horses well enough to stick with<br> quality. Black horses are considered unlucky though: "a fine horse, but<br> she might throw you".<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4.)  Where are the main trade route from Curvau?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>The river west to Minkaraph is the big one.  The other routes are south<br> to Akklai Point and Givos.  Givos is basically a jumping off point for<br> river trade to the south.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 5.)  How are the Mindat viewed in the North (or wherever we are now)<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Severely dislike by most Heteri, unless they have some sort of economic<br> connection.  The Chlendi distrust them (based on history).  Most<br> cultures don't get their lack of clans.  Nobles in "the South" see them<br> as curious and quaint.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 6.)  Do the gods of the various pantheons cooperate with or <br> > combat against each other?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Tricky question.  There's some overlap in the Maetah and Heteri deities.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 7.)  Is there any seafaring?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Not a lot simply because of geography.  The Fog prevents easy access to<br> the Shn (who you haven't encountered yet).  Along the North Sea coast,<br> the weather can get nasty, but the Maetah were originally a seafaring<br> people and still do extensively fishing.  A lot of trade runs along the<br> coast of Ghikarn'gai through to the Mindat homeland.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 8.)  What are the main staple grains in the north?  in the south?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Git is the major crop in the north.  I'll post a writeup if I don't have<br> a link already. Wheat and barley are also grown.  Traditonal rices are<br> the staple in the south, though I really haven't though too much about<br> their agriculture.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 9.)

Heteri is very<br> guturally and Maetah has some softly or unpronounced consonants.<br> Chlendi can be just plain hard.  Give me some troublesome words and I'll<br> add them to the pronunciation list.<br> <br> Uod Cultural Shorthand:<br> <br> - Heteri: If the Mongols had won.<br> - Mindat: Arabic + Chinese<br> - Maetah: Northern European plus a bit of Japan<br> - Chlendi: Arabic + Mayan in a swamp<br> <br> Not truly accurate, but if you think of them in these terms, you won't<br> be completely off base.  I've got some "If I was Heteri" type documents<br> in embryonic form that I should really get back to...<br> <br> If things seem to blur together a little bit, it's a intentional<br> conceit.  I've started you in a little bit of a melting pot, as getting<br> people to play a Mindat right off the bat would be hard.  You've seen a<br> little of more traditional Heteri culture, but only gotten a hint of<br> Maetah or Eskla (the mixed culture of the south).  <br> <br> S.</div></html>|

Due to their climatic <br> situation, Maetah suffered through a stunted growing season, thus <br> forcing them into trade and pillage.<br> <br> Finding the Northern Coasts few denizens tough opponents, Maetah quickly <br> resorted to establishing raiding colonies.

That "Mindat - Let's kill our gods - bit" <br> basically level the center of Asklor taking out a concentration of <br> Chlendi clan leaders. In farther reaches of the empire, local political <br> powers took up the slack, and the Chlendi had priorities beyond exerting <br> military control over those regions.  That's why you've got people with <br> a smattering of noble titles all over the Rhiat (the Baron, the Comte, <br> the Duke in Vennosat, etc).<br> <br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > * What other 'Realms' exist?  (Dream realm, spirit realm ...)<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>The Chlendi only recognize the spirit "otherworld", and see what others <br> would call 'dimensions' as a subset of that.  Various cultures have <br> different views, but none as widely or emperically known.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > * Why do the Chlendi favour the swampy Ramush area?

Chlendi are crappy farmers, which was some of <br> the motivation for enslaving the Maetah. Part of it is spiritual.  They <br> built communities based on astrology and the presence of Amberite. <br> Asklor, for example, is not in a swampy area.</div></html>|

What does the Commerce Guild actually do?  They are the<br> ultimate middlemen.  Under the strict laws of the old Empire, one<br> could not transport goods of another outside of the town borders<br> unless licensed by the Commerce Guild.  Only they could run caravans,<br> though (by law) you could transport and resell your own products.  The<br> Commerce Guild also manages loans, moneychanging, and banking.  For<br> their own safety, a noble would often exchange a large sum of money<br> for a Guild "writ of credit" before leaving town, then "cash out" for<br> the same amount (minus the service fee) at the final destination or<br> stops along the way.  In many towns and cities, the Commerce Guild<br> manages local markets, keeping an eye out for thieves, charging for<br> marketspace, handling transport from warhouses, etc.   <br> <br> - Chlendi Diet:<br> Snake, fowl, swamprat, fish, and shellfish, as well as the variety of<br> fruits and vegetables in the swamp form the basis of the diet. They<br> are masters of finding the edible algae and fungi of the region, and<br> aren't above partaking in the delicacy of large beetles on occasion. <br> Common beverages are a distilled liquor from swamp reed "marrow",<br> herbal concoctions and aromatic teas from the bark and leaves of swamp<br> trees.<br> <br> Traditional Chlendi "table-ware" is a pair of double-ended tools with<br> prongs on one end, and small knife edges on the other.  They are used<br> for both eating, serving, and food prepartion.  Use of these a refined<br> skill a step beyond the use of chopsticks, and being able to eat a<br> fine meal without betraying etiquette is considered a sign of<br> maturity.  Imagine what the Chlendi think of Heteri barbarians eating<br> with their fingers!<br> <br> ------------------<br> <br> A few customs:<br> <br> - The traditional Heteri challenge is to spit at the feet of your foe.<br>  This is a serious offense, and doing so is casue for drawing steel,<br> except by the closest of friends.<br> <br> - Before battle, Heteri will bathe the hooves of their horses in blood<br> for luck.<br> <br> - The rare Chlendi will be born with violet-blue eyes.  This is<br> considered an auspicious omen.  In general, Chlendi consider the<br> colour red to be unlucky.<br> <br> - In the civilized cities of the south, to wear a sword indoors is an<br> offense to the host, indicating that you don't trust him or his<br> ability to protect you.<br> <br> - Minkush River (lit. 'Blood of the Mindat') - renamed after the<br> Chlendi defeated the Mindat at Minkarapht.  Hordes of Mindat corpses<br> were thrown downstream in the river.  Each year to commemorate the<br> battle, items of red colour and thrown in the river to flow downstream.<br> <br> - Before the dominance of the Thedine, Maetah legend held that Uod was<br> infused with magic from the blood of a creator god.  All of the old<br> rites began by a ceremonial bloodletting by the head officiant.  To<br> this day, when important oaths are, the palm is cut or nicked. <br> Convicted criminals will have a slash upon their cheek or forehead<br> made as the conviction is read.</div></html>|

I'm afraid someone would go all American Idol.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Two more questions:<br> > <br> > 1) Is there a worse crime in Heteri society than being a horse thief?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Sure.  Murder.  Horsetheft is/was seen as stealing a *very* valuable<br> item.  Not that most of the populations have become sedentary, horses<br> are still need and honoured, but aren't an absolute necessity for<br> survival.  But I'm sure many Heteri men would rather you steal their<br> wife.  Even in the "old days", the tribes would raid each other.  I<br> suppose it would be an honour to have a "horse worthy of stealing".<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2) Is dueling common among the Heteri?

But not some much in the<br> formal, noble sense - rapiers, pistols at dawn.  They'd be happy to<br> trounce you in the dirt, leave a nice scar, and remind me you of it.<br> Fighting to the death would be only for extreme circumstances, but if<br> you spit at someone's feet, I wouldn't count on being recognizable when<br> the situation is settled.<br> <br> S.</div></html>|

However<br> the idea of being surrounded by so many Heteri is a<br> major downer.<br> <br> How about we stay in Cuvau and become major power<br> players? We start fighting stables in the Hospital,<br> wage an invisible war against the Church of Thedine<br> and the Conte, and Viktor gets to take his shot at Vushu?<br> <br> <br> 	<br> 		<br> __________________________________<br> Do you Yahoo!?<br> New and Improved Yahoo!

I am flexible... if you say the plot goes<br> to the left, i can probably find some 'reasonable' reason that Nisik<br> would go left.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br> > 1. Head north - Fun with the Church of Thedine, Argaevaligne, and<br> > Maetah culture.  Maybe an airship ride at some point.<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>I think i agree with Nate, going North does not seem likely but, if<br> the plot went that way Nisik has a contact in Nipend that needs to be<br> followed up with, perhaps aiding his researches.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2. Head south - Fight the hordes of the Goblin Queen.  Reclaim<br> > Balancont. Secret Societies. Look, we're heroes!<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>This is the one i thought most likely for Nisik, following up on the<br> White Worm stuff, trying to find Kultanhash (or however the ancient<br> City of Sorcerors was called).<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3. Head west - Cities of the Minkush Valley.  Fancy Hats.  Duels. <br> > Watch Rikuu get pissed cause he can't carry a weapon.  Perhaps a<br> > sidetrip to the swamps.<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>If the plot needed to head this way, reasons could be created for<br> Nisik to head back toward home... The anniversary of the Naming Day of<br> his Clan Head/Grandmother/Father; important family business; must<br> report on the successful killing of^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hdelivery to the<br> Baron.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 4. Head east - Heteri civil war.  Have fun.  Find out if you really<br> > stopped those white worms.<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Hmm forgot about the white worms being stopped in the east... Ok Nisk<br> has a reason to go that way as well then.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Give me your thoughts.  The McGuffin can point in any direction.<br>  </span></blockquote>Yeah, a game of Spin the McGuffin!<br> <br> South and perhaps East seem most likely to me; they have the most<br> immediate reference to Nisik's interest in the White Worm Problem.</div></html>|

In the older games there literally a dozen systems.<br> Most of them involve some sort of spell point type analogue, and a<br> "skill check" of sorts to succeed.  <br> <br> In some form, you probably have a "skill" of Conjuring or Summoning.  As<br> you get more points in it, you could summon bigger/better/more stuff.<br> They would stick around for "a scene".  Storyteller doesn't usually go<br> for measuring effects by the turn/minute/whatever.</div></html>|

I grabbed my copy of the new Storyteller system rulebook yesterday<br> morning.  Apparently, they've blown through most of the stock at Gencon,<br> and I'm glad I had them reserve me a copy at Hobby Bunker, as they sold<br> everything they had.  All the meat (for our purposes), is in the<br> Storyteller Core Rulebook which is available online for $12 or $13 (in a<br> freakin' hardcover even).<br> <br> So far, I'm pretty impressed.  Very streamlined.  Attack/damage/etc are <br> all handled with one roll, and some of the clunk and weirdness about the <br> old versions of the system have been straightened out.  The more I look, <br> the more elegance I find.  Makes Unisystem look even more like an <br> awkward knock-off.  The fact that it handles armour damage absorption, <br> instant kills, and still beating someone to death with your fists make <br> me happy.<br> <br> Also a decent way of intergrated all the old-style WoD backgrounds, <br> merits/flaws, and how we could encompass D&D style feats.<br> <br> More propoganda later.

I'll get some print-outs and copies of the rules summaries<br> and synopsis and we can fiddle around.

The costs aren't<br> exponential are Chargen, so it benefits someone who's character is a<br> dedicated sorceror out of the gate.  Otherwise, compare to having a nog<br> (retainer) and being buddies with a city gate guard (contact) in merit<br> cost (2 points).  Nisik being Awareness 3, Chlendi Sorcery 2 at start<br> leaves him with 2 more points of merits, but room for growth.  I'm<br> assuming he got to Sorceror 3 through XP.<br>  <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > You could have each level be the max level of ritual<br> > that can be learned rather then have each level<br> > determine how many incantations/paths you can learn.<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>I was thinking:<br> <br> Awareness 1 = level one incantations/rituals<br> Awareness 2 = Can do Level 1-2 incant's & rituals<br> Awareness 3 = Knows one path.  Can do Level 1-3 incant's & rituals<br> Awareness 3 = Can learn additional paths.

While<br> its harbour welcomes foreign vessels, the rocky outcroppings that<br> populate it prevented the community from become a major trade port,<br> and remains largely the province of fishing vessels.  It has become a<br> popular stopping point for seaborn trade vessels, who anchor in the<br> outer bay and take small skiffs into town for supplies and refreshments.<br> <br> Currently occupied by the Goblin Queen's forces, it is nominally rules<br> by Mivuhwul Isasnias Koman, the middle-aged burgher of fine ancestry<br> who acts as a puppet to the local Captain Nivinak.  Isanias<br> demonstrated his loyalty by killing the previous Mivuhweul in the city<br> square.  Givos, for an unknown radon, was one of the first communities<br> targetted when the goblins rose to the surface.<br> <br> Despite the crumbling walls and downtrodden residents, Givos still<br> welcomes peaceful travellers and merchants, so long as they keep clear<br> of the goblin occupying force.  Discreet travellers can find lodging<br> at the White Witch inn, two blooks in from the east gate.  The<br> sorcerer's lodge of Duslandgarot is still active, but only with a<br> skeleton staff.  They are said to be in the good graces of the gobllin<br> Queen.<br> <br> The city is a mix of Eskla and Heteri ethnicities, and most buildings<br> are small houses of stone and peat, barely able to withstand the<br> stormy summer season.</div></html>|

I'll have to let that percolate in my brain.  <br> <br> I like the basic idea of what we were using last night, but Resolve<br> alone didn't scale enough.  I want to make sure that even cast a "1st<br> level" spell has some possibility of drain, but that one bad roll won't<br> know you right out if you try something a little more.  <br> <br> How's this:<br> <br> (Like before) Base drain is the number of dice you use to cast.  Once<br> again your Resolve attribute (and any successes you care to spare from<br> casting) reduce this.  *But*, instead of taking "X drain levels" minus<br> resolve, your resolve reduces drain as a dice pool, which is then rolled<br> to see how many drain level are done to you.  That probably sounds<br> confusing.<br> <br> Example:<br> <br> 1.  Nisik cast a spell with 6 dice.  Gets three successes, and saves one<br> to help with drain.<br> 2.  Nisik's Resolve is 3.  Add thar success from Step 1, for a total of<br> 4 dice.<br> 3.  This is a penalty to the Drain Pool, which is now reduced to 2 dice.<br> 4.  I roll two dice.  Each success is a level of bruise damage.  <br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > This could be as simple as reducing the dice pool by the <br> > armor number.  Magic armor would have lesser effect and 'Mage <br> > Armor' spell has no such effect.<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>Exactly, though I want to collapse Shield and Mage Armour into one<br> incantation that doesn't sound as dorky as "Mage Armour".</div></html>|

If we remove Resolve then we add on<br> average 2-3 dice but we also remove the Resist Drain<br> factor. Probably if the Resolve was a roll instead of<br> removing dice then we'd get results you want, but that<br> adds a lot of dice and isn't very elegant. <br> <br> <br> 		<br> _______________________________<br> Do you Yahoo!?<br> Declare Yourself - Register online to vote today!<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vote.yahoo.com">http://vote.yahoo.com</a></div></html>|

1008|1008|2004-10-18 11:08:24|widderslainte|A small summation of recent events.|<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=utf-8'></head><div id="ygrps-yiv-781697361">From Nisik's research, it became apparent that the failure to reunite<br> the Baron with his body was due to a an error in the astrological<br> correspondence.  Something had changed in the Baron's location in the<br> dream realm, which ties in with some of the dreams Nisik has had.  After<br> further calculations, Nisik believe the Baron could be returned to a<br> *new* physical form if the ritual was performed at a certain date, a<br> lunar cycle forward, at a hilltop location to the south near Akklai<br> Point in Balancont.<br> <br> The group decided to head south.  Much of Cuvauw was beginning to close<br> up for the winter, and the possibilities of the near South were<br> intriguing.  The Goblin Conquest brought visions of a war economy to<br> Irosk, and new avenues of trade to his Guild.  After visiting Bolog,<br> Rikku was beginning to have delusions of Heteri grandeur, and recovering<br> ancestral lands would be a good selling point in the plan to raise a<br> horde.  Nisik... Always seems to find trouble, so his location didn't<br> really matter.  Viktor saw potential in the wealth and family home in<br> Akklai Point, and had somehow been befriended by the Order of the Velvet<br> Glove, a conglomeration of Maetah and Eskla families with similar aims.<br> <br> Arriving in Givos, they found the town largely empty.  There was still a<br> population there - fisherman were fishing, and the few remaining noble<br> and wealthy had holed in their homes.  The forces from the subterranean<br> goblin realm had taken control of Givos, with the assistance of the<br> Mivehwul (Mayor), who also provided a few hundred Heteri (the lower<br> class) to the goblins for slave labor.  Other townsfolk (including much<br> of the town guard) had bought in with the goblins and were harassing<br> locals and farmers almost as north as Cuvauw.  Along with the goblins<br> came a fever plague that has slowly spread amongst the locals,<br> evidencing itself as a blue rash.  So far it appears more debilitating<br> than life threatening, though "plague masks" and a variety of snake-oil<br> cures are sold all over town.  The only thing more popular than<br> plague-talk are the daily hangings.<br> <br> Their first night in town, Viktor was approaching by Egoen, his<br> (apparent) contact from the Order of the Velvet Glove.  While the<br> Knights of Plausible Deniability had planned to pass through town, maybe<br> stir up a little ruckus, a few local operatives thought Viktor would be<br> arriving as their savior.  Later meeting Egoen down by the docks, he<br> tried to cajole them into grander schemes, involving assassination and<br> such, while Viktor had his mind set on Arson.  Shortly after they<br> arrived, the "troops" joined them: a smattering of dock workers and some<br> violent Heteri rabble.<br> <br> The group set off for the slave pens, in an effort that will ultimately<br> fail.   How, why, and who survives will be determined Thursday night.<br> Anyone who can't make it may end up *in* the slave pens.  Or worse yet,<br> as a host in the food pen.</div></html>|

Nisik slipped<br> aside and found a watery basement filled with the goblins' food: leeches<br> and other parasites, grown upon the semiconscious bodies of slaves.  He<br> worked to disrupt the growing mechanism, and then fled with city with<br> the others.  Irosk stayed behind to nurse his wounds and undertake<br> Commerce Guild business.<br> <br> Viktor, Nisik, and Rikku came ashore from the Givos at a small fishing<br> village down the coast.  The backwards folk there were relatively<br> hospitable and traded coin for lodging and horses, and after a nights'<br> rest the group continued toward the ritual spot. After stumbling upon<br> the savaged remains of travelers, they sought a night's refuge at a<br> local Shrine to Lob, where a pair of acolytes seem to welcome their<br> company, and gave them guidance on treating the blue rash that Viktor<br> had acquired in Givos.  The next morning, after drugging and kidnapped a<br> few pre-Barons from some traveling flagellants,<br> they continued their journey down the Akklai Road.<br> <br> The path, through drainage dug ravine, was littered with the remains of<br> goblins, and the traps that took them down.  A few nigh-abandoned<br> building were at the base of the hill, which had a small road leading<br> along the inlet to the peak, where Nisik's calculations said the ritual<br> should occur.  The path around the hill was edged by small boulders,<br> each with one or more hunks of amberite embedded in them.  Facing the<br> sea, they found a small cave which had been barred and locked.  In walls<br> surrounded the cave mouth were small niches, many filled with shriveled,<br> "preserved" eyeballs.  Upon breaking into the caves they found it<br> deserted, once a mining locale.  Inside were the broken remains of<br> wagons and barrels.  They slept through the night, and awoke to find<br> themselves covered in dusty fingerprints.  They spoke to a local man and<br> his son, who told them of the "Lamplighters" who came by the locale<br> every few years to check on the cave, but knew little detail of their<br> activities.  <br> <br> Tonight, the ritual.<br> <br> S.</div></html>|

They<br> practice the summoning and binding of spirits, divination through those<br> spirits and astrology, as well as some herbalism and aspects of Shamanism.<br> That is the cultural core of what they Chlendi specialize.  Anything else<br> would represent some study of different forms or the syncretistic vomit that<br> is D&D.<br> <br> Theoretically anyone can learn the arts of the Chlendi.  It doesn't take any<br> special birthright or in-born "gift", though they would tell you<br> differently.  You learn the correspondences, the hierarchies of spirits, and<br> how to use the various tools in the rituals (in the loosest sense of the<br> term 'ritual').  The Chlendi differentiate spirits of this world (the milieu<br> - includes spirits of nature and structure within this plane) from the<br> aetheric (those beyond this plane).  The conjunction of stars and other<br> heavenly bodies with the veins and deposits of amberite in Uod is the key to<br> summoning aetheric spirits.<br> <br> Unlike the Mindat, there is no internal force to be harnessed.  Unlike<br> traditional Sorcery of the Maetah, there is not a collection of<br> energy-bearing trinkets that need to be combined with words and gestures.<br> It is knowledge and the force of will.  *That* is why the Chlendi look down<br> on other "scientists" and works of magic.<br> <br> S.</div></html>|

Notes at the bottom:<br> <br> 1. Each spirit has a Force, which indicates it's power (As a general<br> descriptor. A Force 4 Spirit is like saving a Level 7 Fighter). The<br> force determines the strength and abilities of the spirit, as well as<br> the difficulty to summon and control.<br> <br> 2. The sorceror roles his casting power. Each success indicated one<br> "service" the spirit owes the summoner before he departs.<br> <br> 3. The drain is based on the force of the spirit.<br> <br> This is ripped right out of Shadowrun. The problem is ST uses fixed<br> difficulties, where in Shadowrun, the tartget number when you roll<br> your casting pool is determined by the strength of the spirit. That's<br> something we'll have to figure out.<br> <br> Straight from SR:<br> <br> - Aid Sorcery (boost casting pool or absorb drain)<br> - Aid Study<br> - Physical service (move earth, break down gate)<br> - Sustain Spell<br> - Remote Service (surveillence)<br> - Attack<br> - Protection<br> - Divination (my addition)<br> <br> ----------------<br> <br> My suggestion is a change on the drain procedure, at least for<br> conjuring.  Before we did (Drain Dice - Resolve), and each success was<br> a non-lethal level.  NEW IDEA:  Drain = the Force (Ftagn level) of the<br>  spirit, *reduced* by successes rolled on resolve.<br> <br> In last night's case.  Ftagn 4 Spirit = 4 levels of non-lethal. <br> Soaked by success on a Resolve roll.  Perhaps allowing dice from the<br> casting pool to be withheld.</div></html>|

I'll get the A/C cranking for an hour or two prior to<br> everyone's arrival.<br> <br> --------------------<br> Recent events:<br> <br> The airship was re-"fueled" and haphazardly sailed back to the City Beyond<br> the River, where it was left with Voloy and his crew.  They provided some<br> sustenance and locomotion back to the city. The coordinates and offerings of<br> blood were made, and the group returned to Uod in a wholly undramatic<br> sequence.<br> <br> They awoke in a wagon outside Cuvauw, under the care of Dr. Mupheus Thoad<br> and Lum.  Rikuu and Lum had taken the pre-corpses back to Cuvauw after the<br> ritual near Akklai Point.  A few months had passed, and the group returned<br> to Cuvauw to see what had transpired in their absence:<br> <br> - The Goblins have slowly moved further north.  Rikku has "raised a horde"<br> or some semblance to assist in the resistance.<br> - Elle has closed the Manorhouse and moved south with a young man.  His<br> description sounds eerily familiar.<br> - The fights are going well at the Asylum, though Rikuu absconded with much<br> of the profits to fund his horde.  Vanos presented you with a small bag of<br> coins that he's tucked away.<br> <br> Following the man to a house near the slums, the windows shatter and blow<br> out.  The group rushed upstairs to find the remains of a shabby month-long<br> stakeout: four bedrolls, some clothing and personal effects.  Among the<br> items was a notebook {see below) and a scarab-like broach.  In the back of<br> the townhouse, a room covered in silky, spider-like webbing and four open<br> cocoons (one very recent).<br> <br> "The Master bid us South, past Givos, to Akklai Point. The cletches has lost<br> the scent somewhere in route." [Hides the worst of the winter amidst Akklai<br> Point, then describes a routine journey west, and upriver to Imphomonee.]<br> <br> "The locals call the winter here mild. I shudder to think of what my brother<br> is finding in the hills, tracking that damn Heteri. We've been here for<br> three weeks, scouting. Nothing. No hatchings, no visions. Not a damn thing<br> to report. [Two months of bland entries about the weather, root vegetables,<br> and the quality of local whores - raving about Yita's Palace of Flesh]<br> Lamplighters making rounds at the usual locations, bathing at the spring,<br> and surveilling nogs. Nogs for Mustyoch's Love! Nogs. Time to go down to the<br> bar, cringe at the lot of idols and drink away a poor man's sorrows."</div></html>|

This is like<br>    the boar who can keep fighting longer than they should be able to<br>    given their wounds and then suddenly give out and die.<br> <br>    In Storyteller terms the health is added on the 'left' side and any<br>    existing damage is transfered there, then when the duration is up<br>    the extra health is removed and it is all pushed 'right' bruise<br>    upgrading to lethal upgrading to aggravated... thus the person<br>    might be feeling fine and then suddenly die when the duration is<br>    up.<br> <br> 2.

You also get them<br> the first time you successful use a skill during a<br> crawl. You also get them for healing a teammate or<br> using a healing item on another team member. Lastly<br> you get them for a succssful Signature Move (described<br> later).<br> <br> Style Points can be redeemed for a +1 to any d20 roll<br> (max of 10 spent on any one roll). Spent style points<br> are lost.<br> <br> Signature Moves are combo attacks for which your<br> character has become famous. There are three steps to<br> a Signature Move. First is The Call in which you<br> announce to the TV audience that you are about to use<br> your Signature Move. Then you execute two actions is a<br> row which are the move itself. You can't do the same<br> action, but otherwise the action could be a feat and<br> an attack, a feat and a spell, two spells, etc.<br> Successful completion of  a Signature Move is worth 2<br> Style Points.<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

You were put<br> up in suites in the best hotel the city has to offer.<br> Youve been taken to the best restaurants. Youve<br> given all the interviews youve been asked to give.<br> Now its time to get to work and earn your cash and<br> prizes. <br> <br> A limo arrived at your hotel after breakfast and when<br> you reached The Museum you asked the driver to take a<br> spin around this new Crawl venue. Youve heard the<br> story  a fire gutted Bostons Museum of Fine Arts, it<br> was purchased and has been rebuilt into the newest<br> Division III Crawl in America The Museum. Unlike most<br> crawls, which are underground, this one is a building.<br> A big, big building. Classic architecture, white<br> granite blocks, and lots of columns. Youve heard<br> rumors that the fire was less then an accident. If it<br> werent youd like to thank who ever caused it because<br> if you succeed here the fame and fortune will be<br> beyond anything youve tasted. Sadly there arent many<br> rumors about what had been set up inside the building.<br> This is a brand new venue and youre the first team to<br> enter. Your team won the tournament to decide who gets<br> to take the fast crack at The Museum, and youre<br> determined to make the most of this opportunity. <br> <br> The security agents kept the crowd away from your<br> limo, but there were cameras and you couldnt resist a<br> little mugging and signing a few autographs. Then you<br> were lead up to the main entrance, and inside The<br> Museum. Marble floors, lighting for effect, and a<br> long, long hallway down the center. It actually looks<br> like a museum. You werent allowed to get to good a<br> look into the venue itself but were led to the Green<br> Room to start prepping. You expected the Green Room to<br> be the usual cramped, brightly lit room with cardboard<br> furniture and a craft food table thats already been<br> picked over by the staff, but what you found was an<br> individual dressing room for each team member complete<br> with a huge bed, full bathroom, stocked minibar and a<br> table piled high with food. Theres was also an<br> autographed glossy 8x10 of Dungeon Judge Ironwolf, the<br> host of The Museum Crawl. Like a lot of DJs shes an<br> ex-Crawler, in fact she got the best ratings of anyone<br> in her generation. Based on the photo shes still good<br> looking despite her age. <br> <br> After you had some time to settle in the Production<br> Director called a meeting to go over the ground rules<br> for the Crawl.

Details are<br> listed below.<br> <br> *Website Focus Group:<br> Help us decide what to do with our web page. Help make it pretty and easy to<br> use. Tell us all your cool ideas. Details are listed below.<br> <br> A lot is happening as we count the days before Pandemonium moves to<br> Central Square!<br> <br> ------------------------<br> <br> Pandemonium Bonds<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> In order to defray the costs of moving and expansion, we'd like to announce the<br> creation of Pandemonium Bonds. These certificates cost $100 in cash apiece, and<br> deliver $10 in store credit every month from February to December 2006 (eleven<br> payments in all). That's about a 12% interest rate!* Store members are allowed<br> (even encouraged) to buy more than one at a time. For example, a person who<br> buys three Bonds would receive $30 in store credit each month for 11 months. A<br> Bondholder does<br> NOT have to use all of the available credit in a given month -- the unused<br> credit rolls over from month to month.<br> <br> Some fine print: once issued, Pandemonium Bonds share exactly the same status as<br> store gift certificates, store credit traded for used merchandise, or the $25<br> credits issued to store members with every $250 worth of purchases. They are<br> good until the end of the store or the end of the universe, whichever comes<br> first. In the event of the end of the store, there would be a liquidation sale,<br> during which customers with<br> Bonds, Gift Certificates, or any other form of store credit would be able to use<br> it to purchase goods on a first-come, first-served basis.<br> After the sale, all store credits will lose their value. We do not in any way<br> anticipate an end-of-store event; we are simply covering our bases.<br> <br> In the event of the end of the universe, all bets are off!<br> <br> (*Not 10%, because a Bondholder gets payment every month!)<br> <br> <br> <br> Store Website Focus Group<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Anyone who has seen the store website recently will probably agree that it needs<br> a little work. We here at Pandemonium have been kicking around a few neat ideas,<br> but we would like to get some unbiased input from actual web developers. We are<br> putting out a call for any developers interested in batting around some ideas<br> for the store site. Munchies will be provided.<br> <br> <br> Changes in Store Hours<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Starting on Feb. 1st, Pandemonium's business hours will be:<br> <br> Mondays-Saturdays: noon-9pm<br> Sundays: noon-6pm<br> <br> This gives our store staff more time to prepare and plan the move. We apologize<br> to all those early morning SF shoppers out there.<br> <br> The hours of operation at the new store will be:<br> <br> Mondays-Fridays: noon-midnight*<br> Saturdays & Sundays: 10am-midnight*<br> <br> *The retail level of the new store will close at 11pm every night, and<br> no one will be allowed to enter the store after 11pm. However, people<br> gaming or participating in an event downstairs can stay until midnight.<br> We will probably have a "last call" at 10:45pm for anyone who wants to<br> buy something before the registers shut down. :)<br> <br> <br> The Move to Central Square:<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> 1) Our new address is 4 Pleasant Street. There's no storefront at this location<br> currently; right now, it is simply the back half of the 7-11.<br> <br> Take a look by satellite:<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=4+pleasent+st.,+02139&btnG=Search&ll=42.366186,-71.105608&spn=0.003567,0.010654&t=h">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=4+pleasent+st.,+02139&btnG=Search&ll=42.366186,-71.105608&spn=0.003567,0.010654&t=h</a><br> <br> The big white building across from Pleasant Street is the Cambridge Post Office.<br> The new store will face the Post Office. If you squint, you can also see the two<br> municipal parking lots: one right next to the new space and the other diagonally<br> across the street. We plan to buy a digital camera for the store, and we hope to<br> set up the store website so that we can provide a running pictorial update of<br> the renovations.<br> <br> 2) We will be moving out of the Harvard Square space at the end of February.<br> (The Hempest, a clothing store, will be moving into our space.) Pandemonium<br> will close those doors at 6pm on Saturday, February<br> 25th. In an ideal world, the new space will be ready by March 1st, but we know<br> better than to make any unwarranted assumptions. If construction at the new<br> space falls behind schedule, there may be a brief interregnum period. In our<br> biased view, we think you should stock up on good stuff, just in case. To make<br> this easy for you, we will be having a sale….<br> <br> <br> Pandemonium's Moving Sale!!!<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> 1) The sale will start at noon on Thursday, February 16th and run through until<br> the store closes at 6pm on Saturday, February 25th.<br> <br> 2) We will be offering a 20% discount on cash purchases that exceed $50 in<br> total. This applies to everything in the store, except for Black Hole items<br> (which are already discounted 25%-75%). This sale IS compatible with regular<br> store memberships. A $100 purchase would actually cost only $80, and the $80<br> would count towards the normal $250 purchase requirement to get the $25 credit.<br> <br> 3) Pandemonium will not be placing any restock orders after February<br> 16th. If something sells out, it's gone! Items cannot be held. First come, first<br> served.<br> <br> <br> Packing and Unpacking for the Move<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> 1) We will need help packing up the store starting at 6pm Saturday, February<br> 25th, and continuing until Monday night, February 27th. If you are interested,<br> please email us at general at pandemoniumbooks.com<br> with the subject line "Packing Help". Pay will be $9/hour in store credit.<br> Please indicate in the email what days/hours you would be able to work. Thanks!<br> <br> 2) Since we cannot predict whether the construction will be completed on time,<br> we are holding off asking for help for now. Watch the skies!<br> <br> <br> Event Planning at the New Store: Looking for Hosts<br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Pandemonium is now putting out a call for volunteers to help out with events.<br> Job description as follows:<br> <br> Title: Host<br> Pay: zip! {but perqs are possible; we're still working on those…}<br> Duties: You will be in charge of running a regular event of your own devising in<br> Pandemonium's social space on the lower level of the new store.

At the designated time<br> of the event, you'll show up and try to make sure everybody has a good time.<br> Usually, this will require you to take the role of a moderator or referee.<br> During the event, you'll keep the noise level down and minimize property<br> damage. After the event, you'll thank everyone for coming, and make sure all<br> participants have picked up their trash.<br> <br> PLEASE NOTE: Event hosts are not Pandemonium employees.* If problems occur, the<br> Host should contact the store manager on site.<br> * - The exception, of course, is when current employees host Events. But you<br> know what we mean.<br> <br> Process of Event Development:<br> <br> 1) Send us a brief write-up, including:<br> - A description of the event. (A book club; a knitting circle; a game of<br> Shadowrun for beginners or people who have never played before; a "Lost" fan<br> club, etc.). The event must be open to all store members. If the event is to be<br> held regularly and there are limited openings, store members who have not yet<br> had a chance to participate get dibs over those who have.<br> - When you would want to hold it, and how often. (One time only; weekly;<br> semi-monthly or monthly). Really ambitious events requiring many hosts to<br> organize might be held once a quarter or once a year.<br> Examples: a haunted house charity in October, or a seasonal Art Show.<br> - A minimum and maximum number of participants<br> - An estimated duration of the event.<br> <br> 2) Once the event is approved, the Host will be assigned a "SpaceTime": a<br> specific part of the store to use during a given time slot. We will craft a<br> sign-up sheet and event description that will be posted on the store's bulletin<br> board and website.<br> <br> 3) Interested store members sign up! If the number of participants exceeds the<br> minimum, the event takes place, and everybody has a good time!<br> <br> Generally speaking, an event should be somehow associated with the genres of<br> science fiction, fantasy, or horror. Furthermore, an event should involve an<br> activity that a Host enjoys. Pandemonium simply provides a venue for that<br> activity. Most events should only take up a small part of the total space.<br> Larger events might require some sort of cover charge. This will be handled on<br> a case-by-case basis. To our knowledge, no other store has undertaken to<br> provide such a broad array of fan events. As a result, we will be making up a<br> lot of this as we go along!<br> <br> Individual store members or a group will be able to book and rent space for<br> private functions, ranging from a single gaming table to the entire downstairs<br> area. See Ruth or Tyler for details.<br> <br> That is all for now.

You're free to change your mind, especially<br> if something happens in game that inspires your ideas<br> about character advancement. For example a possible<br> Goal I see from play would be "Salvage Expert" or<br> "Regulator Captain". It'll be more difficult to see<br> future advancement at this early part in the game, but<br> as we hit critical story mass it should become easier.<br> <br> I'd like to give skill points out about once every<br> other session or so, which should cover an "episode".<br> As with your character Goal feel free to change it up,<br> but if we know before hand what your characters are<br> working towards we can make that part of the game. For<br> example if Top Gun is teaching some of you to ride,<br> you could say you plan to put your next skill point<br> into Ride. <br> <br> After spending your fourth skill point you get to add<br> a new Aspect and Stunt.<br> <br> Questions?<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

So<br> going from Unskilled to Fair/+1 costs one skill point.<br> Going from Fair/+1 to Good/+2 costs one point.<br> <br> The Teaching skill will have an impact on the game.<br> That's one of the reasons I want to know what skills<br> the characters are working to develop. If you've got a<br> teacher you'll be able to advance more quickly. Also<br> Teaching will allow people to learn highly technical<br> skills which you wouldn't be able to self-teach (like<br> Medicine, Engineering, Science, etc.).<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

Part I is to come up with your character's<br> Distinctive Items. What does your character wear or<br> carry that would definitely have to be on his action<br> figure? I'm talking Indiana Jones' hat and whip,<br> Magnum PI's Hawaiian shirt and Detroit Tigers hat, or<br> Wolverine's cigar and sideburns. Extra credit if you<br> come up with backstory about why the gear is<br> meaningful to your character. <br> <br> Example: Rance Allen has long, dirty blonde hair he<br> pulls back in a tight pony tail. He wears a suede<br> jacket with tassles. Like this one:<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blair.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=23963">http://www.blair.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=23963</a><br> <br> Part II is to decide on a signature hat. In the winter<br> in Colorado people wear hats. Especially if they're<br> out foraging the war stricken countryside. Cowboy hats<br> are popular, as are skiing hats. Describe the style,<br> color, and any emblems/sports teams logos/company<br> logos it bears, how you got it and if its just<br> practical or has some emotional value.<br> <br> Example: Vern "Bouncer" White is fond of his well-worn<br> black straw cowboy hat with snakeskin band.<br> <br> Completing the homework is worth 1 FP at the start of<br> next session.<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

On a practical<br> level, we had plenty of reason to work together as a scavenger team. As <br> cops, I don't know.  I'm happy to hand wave it and say we're buddies in <br> the interest of the campaign, but we should at least make it clear. <br> Knowing last nights events were pertinent to us "as a team" would have <br> ramped up Mitch's interest a bit.<br> <br> Right now, he's a reactive character, which was part of the charm of his <br> concept. I either need to change him a little or change his relationship <br> to the group.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > What do you want more of? Dial up the sci-fi? Dial up<br> > the threat of violence?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>I would say both, out of personal preference.  I don't know that we need<br> more sci-fi, but I wouldn't say that it feels like 50 years in the<br> future.  Part of the that is the post-war collapse, though, so a lot of<br> the technological changes are out of the pictures.  But we might as well<br> be playing in 2003 as far as it appears.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > What do you want less of? Dial down the Denial? Dial<br> > down the politics?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>I don't mind the politics.  But at the onset it sounded like more of a<br> survival game, so I've got survival skills that have limited use at<br> cookouts.<br> <br> -- <br> -------------------------<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:widderslainte@comcast.net">widderslainte@comcast.net</a></div></html>|

1838|1838|2006-06-02 15:32:04|widderslainte|Some brief history on Vennosat City|<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=utf-8'></head><div id="ygrps-yiv-2122196643">(Added to wiki and awaiting proofing)<br> <br> Vennosat City has always been a wealthy, active port since sedentary <br> population inhabited the Rhiat.  After the dissolution of the Heteri <br> Kings, and the unifying violence of the Chlendi Empire, Eskla and <br> Chlendi nobles took control of the town, ruling by the grace and proxy <br> of the Empire.  As the largest port in the Rhiat, most goods went sent <br> up river through Vennosat City to the core of the Empire.  When the <br> Mindat Wars shifted the the eastern front, the Emperor's council placed <br> immense tariffs and taxes on shipping and trade flowing though the city <br> to fund the effort.  With the backing of the the Shn-Kvaruth, and the <br> sabotage of Mindat cells, the noble houses pooled their might and <br> declared independence in 2679.<br> <br> Now burdened the infrastructure of a new nation, and lacking the order <br> and numbers of a military, Vennosat City became an immense "frontier <br> town" as merchants and less savory traders took advantage of new found <br> out economic possibilities.  Any guilds without noble ties to the new <br> regime were shut off the market rush, and fought their way back in to <br> trade among peasants. The wharf district was overrun with slave trade, <br> as much of the indentured labor was dragged north when the Empire pulled <br> out.  Noble houses, now the rulers of a nation, were content to profit <br> and hide behind the walls of the manorhouses.  They took over the royal <br> enclave in the western hill, and walled the district off to forestall <br> the rapidly encroaching wharf distract, and it's accompanying filth and <br> disease.  Other noble families took residence in the burgeoning city of <br> Noduan on the southern coast.  As long as the profits were strong, the <br> nobles were content, and underseers began bargaining with underworld <br> gangs and guild influences to make their cut on the side.  These deals <br> spawned modern crime syndicates such as the Viceers and the Blacktongues.<br> <br> But everyone from Vensat knew that if profits were at stake it could not <br> last.  After his head accountant and his family were slaughtered, Venras <br> Ducat, newly "crowned" head of the city oligarchy, took action.  A <br> veteran of border conflicts with Balancont, he brought violence to bear, <br> hiring an entire troupe of Heteri mercenaries as his private army with <br> the city.  They swept through the wharf district, cutting down or <br> shackling able bodied men, and razing buildings to the ground.  Faced <br> with a labour shortage and loss of merchandise, the guild had little <br> option than to strike a deal with the noble houses.<br> -- <br> -------------------------<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:widderslainte@comcast.net">widderslainte@comcast.net</a></div></html>|

I think the trick for an "interim <br> game" would be something that doesn't require a lot of setting and <br> system explanation, and where we can through the characters right into a <br> story and get some reasonable conclusion.<br> <br> To completely ignore my prior statement, we *could* do a Shadowrun, <br> which is a much more streamlined system (like World of Darkness but with <br> d10s).  Build characters and run through a mission or two.  We could <br> also try something like Burning Wheel, which is designed to be <br> Tolkein-ish fantasy.  We'd spend a little more time learning the system, <br> and then take some stock characters through a brief adventure to see how <br> cool the system is.<br> <br> <br> S.<br> <br> -- <br> -------------------------<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:widderslainte@comcast.net">widderslainte@comcast.net</a></div></html>|

1953|1953|2006-09-01 12:15:54|Nathaniel Bennett|AGoT General Strategy Notes|<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=utf-8'></head><div id="ygrps-yiv-1678235752">I've joined the AGoT board game Yahoo group and<br> compiled these general strategy notes from several<br> posts. Sorry the formatting sucks.<br> <br> *Spread out! Give your armies room to grow, especially<br> early in the<br> game. Be ready for when a muster card appears. Don't<br> be caught<br> huddled around your cities and strongholds. In each of<br> the first and<br> second rounds of the game, try to take a<br> city/stronghold territory<br> AND a territory with a barrel. Supply and mustering go<br> hand in hand.<br> Don't ignore the barrels in favor of<br> cities/strongholds for<br> mustering. You'll regret it later<br> <br> *Don't forget raids, and use them for more than<br> removing an<br> opponent's consolidate power tokens. Use them to<br> remove support, and<br> watch your foes squirm. This may seem elementary, but<br> I think that<br> raids are too often overlooked (at least in my group).<br> We have these<br> huge number crunching battles with these high attack<br> and defend<br> values, a great portion of which come from support.<br> There is nothing<br> better than wiping out support that someone is<br> depending on for<br> their survival.<br> <br> *Yes, the sword token is greatbut don't forget the<br> raven token! It<br> is a great tool for feints and trickery, especially<br> when it might be<br> time to turn an ally into an enemy. Use its ability<br> that allows you<br> to switch a played order for an unplayed order to<br> create confusion<br> and set up ambushes. And if you can get your hands on<br> both the sword<br> and the raven at the same time, even better! Both of<br> these tokens<br> should not be ignored. If you have one (or both), you<br> should be<br> thinking of how to use them EVERY TURN!<br> <br> *Ships are there for more than just support and raids!<br> Always be<br> aware of where your ships can potentially serve as<br> "bridges" for<br> your troops. Use them for long-range attacks,<br> especially when you<br> think your opponent is not aware of their peril!<br> Watching the<br> expression of someone you just ambushed via a "ship<br> bridge" is<br> priceless! Be cunning with those ships!<br> <br> *During the Clash of Kings, do not bid "blindly."<br> Always have a<br> reason for bidding what you bid, and always keep<br> thinking about how<br> each area of influence pertains to your strategy.<br> Don't grab for<br> those influence tokens just to have them! If you know<br> that you need<br> to wage some battles in the next turn or so, go for<br> the sword. If<br> you need to be crafty, go for the raven. If you want<br> to mess with<br> your opponents' positions on the influence tracks, get<br> the throne!<br> And don't be afraid to let those tokens go when the<br> time is right,<br> either. Don't bankrupt yourself, spending all your<br> power tokens,<br> just to hold on to an influence token!<br> <br> *Develop your group's fluency with (and comfort with)<br> table talk! It<br> spices up a game and gives it great flavor, especially<br> if there are<br> people in your group that have read the books in the<br> series. Sneer<br> and jeer, make and break alliances, call each other<br> "blackguards"<br> and "whoresons" and whatnot. But always remember that<br> it is all in<br> fun and don't take it too seriously. It really adds<br> something to the<br> experience.<br> <br> *Try to use multiple adjacent marches to confuse foes.<br> You can, for<br> example, march units from one or more different<br> territories into an<br> area that already has a march token to build up your<br> strength before<br> launching a major attack. If your opponent sees<br> multiple marches<br> across a front, they will not know from which<br> territory an attack<br> may come until it is too late. This becomes especially<br> deadly when<br> used in conjunction with the raven token. In general,<br> always<br> remember that it's the attack the enemy does not see<br> coming that<br> hurts them the most. Use feints whenever you can.<br> <br> *Always take the opportunity to dig through your<br> opponent's<br> character graveyard to see which House characters they<br> have used.<br> Use process of elimination to determine what cards<br> they have left in<br> their hand before attacking them.<br> <br> *Don't let emotions carry you away! Be calm, and<br> remember to not let<br> a lost battle bring you down. Your fortunes can change<br> a lot in this<br> game, and very quickly. Don't convince yourself that<br> you are ever<br> out of the game because of your mistakes, especially<br> early on. Don't<br> declare someone your mortal enemy just because they<br> attack you.<br> Remember to not let your emotions show too much, keep<br> a game face<br> on. Watch the reactions of your enemies closely. "Know<br> your enemy,"<br> as Sun Tzu says in The Art of War.<br> <br> *Always seek to take the chance to make pacts and<br> temporary<br> alliances. This can take pressure off of you so you<br> can focus on<br> just a few enemies at a time, instead of trying to<br> fight all of your<br> opponents at once. And always be on the lookout for<br> opportunities to<br> pit your foes against one another. REMEMBER: The enemy<br> of your enemy<br> is your friend<br> <br> -Move last.<br> -Support orders are huge, and can help in solidifying<br> your front while<br> you move up fresh troops or just consolidate<br> elsewhere.<br> -Watch your supply. Keep in mind you needn't hold the<br> territory with<br> supply, so can leave it empty or occupied by other<br> houses until you<br> need it.<br> -In keeping with supply above, don't spend alot of<br> power controlling<br> territory. For the most part, I tend to spend power to<br> control only<br> muster points that I will be leaving empty.<br> -Don't overbid on influence, or bid just because the<br> sword/throne/raven<br> looks cool. Think carefully on what form of influence<br> you most need<br> for the upcoming turn(s) and bid on that. Estimate who<br> your<br> competitors for that track will be based on the board<br> situation and<br> watch their power closely, then bid apprpriately.<br> -Naval marches (moving land forces via navies) are<br> lethal, as they can<br> move forces far more rapidly across the board than on<br> land. Watch for<br> this. Combined with the powerful support orders, this<br> means you must<br> control the sea to a certain degree. Without which,<br> you likely cannot<br> win the game.<br> -Options. When placing orders, give yourself the most<br> options. Having<br> multiple routes of attack/retreat combined with<br> multiple marches are<br> key. When used with naval marches and the move last<br> doctrine, you can<br> decide when and where to hit the hardest.<br> <br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

Here's a rundown of whats<br> added:<br> <br> FORTIFICATIONS<br> By spending a Consolidate Power order you can build<br> fortifications which give defending units +1 combat<br> power. Fortifications are destroyed if all defending<br> units leave the territory.<br> <br> SIEGE ENGINES<br> Siege Engines are a new unit. They cost 2 to muster<br> (like knights) and have combat strength 4 when<br> attacking cities, strongholds or foritifications, and<br> combat strength 0 when attacking any other unit type<br> or defending. Siege engines can't retreat and are<br> destroyed if forced to retreat.<br> <br> PORTS<br> Eight ports are added to the map. Ports are additional<br> locations that are essentially part of the land<br> territory they are on. They allow for additional ship<br> unit mustering, and they allow ships to Consolidate<br> Power.<br> <br> ONE TIME ORDERS<br> Four new order types which can each only be used once<br> per game. They reduce the randomness of the card draws<br> for the most part. They are:<br> <br> Recruit (you muster in that location)<br> Supply Caravan (increase your supply by the amount of<br> the territory).<br> Forced March (move as many units from adjacent<br> territories as you'd like)<br> House specific one time orders, which vary per house.<br> <br> Playing with the new rules probbaly makes the game<br> longer so that we'd need two weeks to finish a game.<br> What do y'all think?<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

1970|1970|2006-10-06 09:06:39|Nathaniel Bennett|Pandemonium: State of the Store|<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=utf-8'></head><div id="ygrps-yiv-740777635">The financial situation of Pandemonium came up last<br> night so I've pasted the State of the Store posted to<br> Pandemonium's livejournal blog. <br> <br> The State of the Store and Plans for the Future<br> <br> In regards to the stores financial situation, let me<br> hasten to inform everybody that this does not mean the<br> end of the store.  Sure, things are dire, but in<br> Pandemoniums 18-year history, this sort of thing has<br> happened before.  Cash goes crunch, and then we have<br> to live on hardtack for a year or two.   I had hoped<br> that we would be able to avoid this sort of austerity<br> program, but things did not work out that way.  It<br> sucks, but the store is likely to survive. Now that we<br> have made these painful cuts, our money situation<br> should start improving slooowly over the next few<br> months.  If we ignore the Mecha Debt (and lets, shall<br> we?), Pandemonium is otherwise in a pretty good<br> position.  We successfully made the move to Central<br> Square, keeping the core of our customer base.  Events<br> at the store are beginning to gain momentum, and I<br> hope to see business pick up as a result of that. <br> Additionally, while we will be losing our full-time<br> employees, I have been deeply impressed by the quality<br> and dedication of our part-timers.  Over the last<br> three months, they have taken on increasingly larger<br> amounts of the workload and I am confident that they<br> will be able to handle their responsibilities without<br> constant supervision.  I hope that the people who come<br> to work at the store in the next month will be of the<br> same caliber.<br> <br> However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the<br> store still needs to significantly increase its<br> revenues if it is going to get out of its current<br> situation with any speed.  Having looked at this<br> problem for awhile now, I am actually not going to ask<br> people to spend more at Pandemonium.  While it would<br> be good for us in the short term, it would mean poorer<br> customers and lower sales in the longer term. <br> <br> So what should we do?<br> <br> What the store needs now is not more money per se, but<br> rather more regular customers.  While Pandemoniums<br> customer base is extremely loyal, it is not very<br> large.  The store only has about one thousand regular<br> customers (regular defined as someone who comes in<br> at least once every sixty days).  When I was drafting<br> my business plan in school last year, I calculated<br> that the store only got about 3-4% of the total<br> science fiction literature market of the greater<br> Boston area.  There is a very large number of fans in<br> the Boston area who simply are unaware of the stores<br> very existence.  I think this is especially true on<br> the college campuses in Boston proper and in the<br> suburbs beyond the reach of public transportation. <br> Our task then is to increase Boston fan awareness of<br> the store.<br> <br> Even as I write this, commercials for the store are<br> playing on the SciFi Channel in the 86,000 RCN<br> households of the Metro Boston area.  This is our<br> first foray into cable advertising, and while I have<br> hopes for it, I think there is a better way to let<br> people know about the store.<br>  <br> <br> Missionaries Wanted!<br> <br> One of the things I learned about in business school<br> is how very, very effective word-of-mouth can be in<br> insuring the success of a business.  Starbucks, for<br> example, does virtually no advertising.  They built<br> the stores and people came.  Of course, they built<br> stores people wanted to come to, stores that customers<br> were willing to recommend to their friends. <br> Pandemonium has relied on word-of-mouth nearly<br> exclusively over the last 18 years.  Now, with your<br> cooperation, we would like to do so again in a more<br> directed effort, in what I am calling Pandemoniums<br> Missionary Fan program.           <br> <br> Its a simple referral program.  Anyone who comes into<br> the store and becomes a store member as a result of a<br> customer recommendation will receive a 20% discount<br> off their first purchase.  Furthermore, if that new<br> customer buys at least $50 within the first year of<br> membership, the customer who recommended the new<br> member will receive $5 in store credit.   It this way,<br> everyone benefits.  The new customer gets a great<br> discount (plus discovers a new store), the referring<br> customer gets a little reward, and the store gets a<br> new customer.  <br> <br> This is how it will work: in the next few days,<br> customers will be able to pick up Missionary cards at<br> the store. Recommending customers (Missionaries)<br> write their names on one side of the card, and give<br> them out to friends who have not yet become store<br> members (Converts).  The Convert simply fills out<br> the other side of the card (name, zip code,<br> email/phone#), and brings it in on their first visit.<br> <br> If this program generates even 100 new regular<br> customers, it will give the store a major long-lasting<br> boost.  I hope customers reading this will take a<br> moment to look around to see if you have perhaps one<br> or two friends who have never gotten around to<br> visiting the store.  The program, like Pandemonium<br> itself, depends on your participation to make it work.<br>  Thanks again to all the wonderful customers, past,<br> present and future, who have helped Pandemonium stay<br> alive for 18 years, and hopefully will keep it alive<br> for another 18 years.  <br> <br> See you in the store!<br> <br> __________________________________________________<br> Do You Yahoo!?<br> Tired of spam?

In it, he<br> proclaimed himself Emperor of the Galaxy, revealed the<br> treason of the Jedi Order, and outlined his vision of<br> transforming the thenceforth-abolished Galactic<br> Republic into the new Galactic Empire.<br> <br>  Jedi Rebellion, the attempt by the Jedi Order to<br> overthrow the Palpatine Government and replace it with<br> a Force-worshiping theocracy. Across the galaxy<br> treasonous Jedi and their allies worked against the<br> people and their lawful Government, including a Jedi<br> attempt to assassinate Palpatine himself under the<br> pretext that that Palpatine wouldnt immediately step<br> down when the Jedi declared that the war was over with<br> Grievous death, rather than waiting to see if the<br> fighting was actually going to end. Information<br> gathered from the Jedi Archives proves that the Jedi<br> Order itself engineered the Clone Wars. Separatist<br> leader Count Dooku acted on orders from the Jedi<br> Council and it was Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas who ordered<br> the creation of the Republics clone army. The Jedi<br> ordered the clone troopers of the Grand Army to be<br> short-lived because the Jedi wouldnt need them once<br> they had overthrown the Palpatine Government. The plot<br> of the Jedi was foiled by Emperor Palpatine and the<br> clone troops which proved to be loyal to the<br> Government and not their Jedi overlords by executing<br> Executive Order 66. The Order branded the Jedi as<br> traitors and called for their immediate execution<br> without question.<br> <br>  COMPOR (the Commission for the Preservation of the<br> Republic) has been replaced by a new organization,<br> COMPNOR (the Commission for the Preservation of the<br> New Order).  <br>  <br>  63 Senators have been arrested on charges of<br> conspiracy and treason in the wake of the "Jedi<br> rebellion." At this time, the latest names added to<br> the list of traitors are Ivor Drake of Kestos Minor,<br> Streamdrinker of Tynna, Shea, Sadashassa of Herdessa,<br> Tanner Cadaman of Fennix, Grebleips of Brodo Asagi,<br> and Fang Zhar of Sern Prime.  <br>  <br>  The Trade Federation, under Acting Viceroy Sentepeth<br> Findos, has been nationalized as part of the Empire. <br>  <br>  The new regional governors, Moffs, who will now be a<br> direct link between various sectors and the Emperor<br> himself. Among the first Moffs announced to the public<br> are Wilhufff Tarkin, Denn Wessex, and Marcellin<br> Wessel. <br>  <br>  Citizens are urged to register their names,<br> political persuasion, and weapons with Imperial<br> authorities for the greater good.<br>  <br>  Citizens are urged to help the new Empire by being<br> clone donors, joining the military, joining COMPNOR,<br> and becoming "eyes" for the Empire.<br>  <br>  Non-human residents of the Empire are urged to<br> register with their local Imperial representative.<br>  <br>  Jedi fugitives still at large include Kai Justiss,<br> Halagad Ventor, Qu Rahn, Ydra Kiwallen, Maw the<br> Boltrunian, and Ranik Solusar.  <br>  <br>  The Senate Rotunda has been closed to repair damage<br> caused by Jedi Master Yoda in his failed attempt to<br> assassinate the Emperor.<br>  <br>  It is against Imperial law to salvage from the<br> wreckage of the Battle of Coruscant. <br>  <br>  An industrial accident has reduced refining capacity<br> in the Mustafar system resulting in a price increase<br> for dolovite to 760 credits per barrel.<br>  <br>  This year's Caamasi "Rainbow of Sunshine" Festival<br> has been cancelled.<br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> ____________________________________________________________________________________<br> Yahoo!

The anniversary of the<br> Declaration's issue will henceforth be celebrated as<br> Empire Day. <br> <br> The full text:<br> <br> "Citizens of the civilized Galaxy, on this day we mark<br> a transition. For a thousand years, the Republic stood<br> as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But<br> there were those who would set us against one another,<br> and we took up arms to defend our way of life against<br> the Separatists. In so doing, we never suspected that<br> the greatest threat came from within.<br> <br> The Jedi, and some within our own Senate, had<br> conspired to create the shadow of Separatism using one<br> of their own as the enemy's leader. They had hoped to<br> grind the Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their<br> hearts could not be hidden forever. At last, there<br> came a day when our enemies showed their true natures.<br> <br> The Jedi hoped to unleash their destructive power<br> against the Republic by assassinating the head of<br> government and usurping control of the clone army. But<br> the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by<br> those without elitist, dangerous powers. Our loyal<br> clone troopers contained the insurrection within the<br> Jedi Temple and quelled uprisings on a thousand<br> worlds.<br> <br> The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.<br> Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These<br> have been trying times, but we have passed the test.<br> The attempt on my life has left me scarred and<br> deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been<br> stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been<br> defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We<br> stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to<br> ensure our security and continuing stability, the<br> Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic<br> Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure<br> you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that<br> will continue to be ruled by this august body and a<br> sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by<br> the majority, ruled by a new constitution.<br> <br> By bringing the entire Galaxy under one law, one<br> language, and the enlightened guidance of one<br> individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic<br> in its later years will never take root. Regional<br> governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed<br> the Separatist movement to grow unchecked. A strong<br> and growing military will ensure the rule of law.<br> <br> Under the Empire's New Order, our most cherished<br> beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals<br> by force of arms. We will give no ground to our<br> enemies and will stand together against attacks from<br> within or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take<br> heed: those who challenge Imperial resolve will be<br> crushed.<br> <br> We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but<br> the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge.<br> Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war for<br> peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings<br> now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will<br> grow as more planets feel the call, from the Rim to<br> the wilds of unknown space.<br> <br> Imperial citizens must do their part. Join our grand<br> star fleet. Become the eyes of the Empire by reporting<br> suspected insurrectionists. Travel to the corners of<br> the Galaxy to spread the principles of the New Order<br> to barbarians. Build monuments and technical wonders<br> that will speak of our glory for generations to come.<br> <br> The clone troopers, now proudly wearing the name of<br> Imperial stormtroopers, have tackled the dangerous<br> work of fighting out enemies on the front lines. Many<br> have died in their devotion to the Empire. Imperial<br> citizens would do well to remember their example.<br> <br> The New Order of peace has triumphed over the shadowy<br> secrecy of shameful magicians. The direction of our<br> course is clear. I will lead the Empire to glories<br> beyond imagining.<br> <br> We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We<br> move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of<br> the first Galactic Empire. We will prevail. Ten<br> thousand years of peace begins today."<br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> ____________________________________________________________________________________<br> Any questions?

The first part is risky<br> but seemingly straightforward - you drop the Senator<br> off in the Cophrigin System and then take Kerrado home<br> to papa on Nar Shadda. <br> <br> However I'm not sure what your plan is about finding<br> somewhere to drop the younglings or how you plan to<br> find other jedi and get a grip on the Jedi Apocalypse<br> that happened while it was sleepy time.<br> <br> The Galaxy is a big place and the Jedi have been<br> around for 10,000 years. As such they have a major<br> infrastructure throughout the Galaxy. However most of<br> that was paid for by the Republic which means its<br> matter of public record. However the size and age of<br> the Jedi Order means there are places that are off the<br> beaten path like the Jedi Temple on the ice world from<br> the Clone Wars animated series. Rather then try and<br> research very Jedi outpost in the expanded universe<br> I'd rather you guys use your creativity and Force<br> Points for dramatic editting. You want your character<br> to know about a secret Jedi Temple? Spend a Force<br> Point and make it so!<br> <br> Thoughts?

This is done through a proper understanding of harmonics.  As... part of my honeymoon, I ... we... went to a performance.  It started with one voice. One singer. She was barely whispering. Another voice joined her, and another, and after that another.  In the end there were 15 women whispering a beautiful song.  It could be heard througout the auditorium. And than they raised the volume of thier voices. and it became almost deafening.  </div> <div> </div> <div>What does this have to do with anything?</div> <div>My question is, "in much the same way that a song can be amplified, can the 'harmonics' of the jedi mediation be amplified to sense what is out there? to ... see how many more are out there that haven't been caught?"  I don't know how many prison ships they have. I dont' know if there are more Jedi cut-off in those energy bubbles. But I do know that you 'felt' Aura Sing in the next room. Can you... maybe together feel the jedi throughout the galaxy? Do you need names? Are all of the light sabers in the box that belonged to General Grevious those of dead jedi?  Maybe some still live?  If not the whole galaxy can you do this while we travel to the outer rim? We are starting in the core and moving to the rim.

We have some able young jedi here. we could go to that cloner planet and raise up an army to fight this old army. of course we also have the brilliant mind of a sadistic and powerful tactician who was taught many things by sith, we could use him as a template if we could find a way of quashing the evil parts.

So the considerations are a) Do the<br> players want to add space combat as a major game<br> element and b) is the story going in a direction in<br> which it makes sense to pick up space combat skills?<br> Which brings us back to the question of what kind of<br> game do we want moving forward?<br> <br> What I'm not<br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > down with rearranging <br> > my existing (and already schizophrenic) skill<br> > pyramid to resemble <br> > Starbuck.

Jump, push/pull, basic Mind<br> Trick. This might be a result of the encounters<br> themselves, or it might be because we've got weak<br> rules for the Force. So I've been thinking about ways<br> to add Force crunch without adding lots of new rules.<br> My current idea is to add the concept of Force<br> Techniques.<br> <br> A Force Technique is a specific use of the Force the<br> character has learned. Force Techniques cost 1/2 skill<br> point each and require the player to spend a Force<br> Point to activate (or two if the stunt normally<br> requires an FP). Force Techniques mimic existing<br> Spirit of the Century stunts. Characters would gain a<br> few basic force techniques through their Jedi<br> training, and would then have to learn the rest<br> through play. SotC stunts which have pre-reqs would<br> require the same stunt as a Force Technique pre-req.<br> So for example "Face the Pain" (an Endurance stunt)<br> requires the stunt "Feel the Burn". A Jedi character<br> would need the Force Technique "Feel the Burn" before<br> they could take "Face the Pain".<br> <br> Sadly there's no easy to use list of stunts available<br> so here's the list of skills which you can use stunts<br> as Force Techniques. In some cases not all stunts<br> would make sense as Force Techniques (eg Vehicles):<br> <br> Athletics<br> Awareness<br> Coercion<br> Deftness<br> Empathy<br> Endurance<br> Prowess<br> Rapport<br> Resolve<br> Search<br> Stealth<br> Survival<br> Vehicles<br> <br> Characters may still buy the stunts normally and use<br> them normally (ie without spending a Force Point to<br> use  it as a Force Technique).<br>  <br> Thoughts?<br> <br> <br>  <br> ____________________________________________________________________________________<br> 8:00? 8:25? 8:40?

Body/Project/Mind complement <br> different abilities at different levels of Force skill, if you spend a <br> tick.  It's hard to keep track of without spend 5 minutes during your <br> action skimming through it (oh, wait, my athletics is better than my <br> force).  Other stuff like "They may spend a Force Point for +2 on any <br> single Endurance or Deftness test, once per Scene" isn't as useful when <br> you have a Jedi aspect to two you can invoke under most of the same <br> circumstances.<br> <br> There's plenty of stuff we're missing.  I suspect most of use have a <br> rough idea of what we should be able to do and spend point/make rolls to <br> try to get it to happen.  Stuff like "May spend a Force Point to use <br> their Force Ability in place of any associated Ability test, once per <br> Scene" could be cool, if you remember you can do it, and even then with <br> the nature of the skill pyramid, it's probably about the same dice <br> probability as somehow using a force point with a normal roll on the skill.<br> <br> <blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Characters may still buy the stunts normally and use<br> > them normally (ie without spending a Force Point to<br> > use  it as a Force Technique).<br> >  <br> > Thoughts?<br> <br>  </span></blockquote>The concept is cool, but with the list of stunts may remain unwieldy. <br> On top of that, it's not like we've got stunts to burn (in case of prereqs).<br> <br> We have the following to describe what we can do and how well:<br> * Force stunts<br> * Force skills (force, lightsaber at least)<br> * Force-related aspects<br> <br> We've got force points as currency to limit how often we can do stuff. <br> I think the more subsystems we add, the more it detracts from the point <br> of investing in a "force skill".<br> <br> Perhaps we should start by making a list of "what jedi can do" and go <br> from there.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> -- <br> -------------------------<br> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:widderslainte@comcast.net">widderslainte@comcast.net</a></div></html>|

I<br> like the second idea a lot where you buy off stress<br> with Consequences and if you exceed your stress track<br> you go right to Taken Out.<br> <br> -NB<br> <br> Here's what I'd do to make Fate hurt more. Some of<br> this is going to show its face in the Dresden Files<br> RPG because ... well, we want it to hurt more. (SOTC<br> tends to be more a case of heroes who just don't fall<br> down a lot -- that's somewhat by design, but we do<br> admit it doesn't always work right for everyone.)<br> <br> Reduce the number of stress boxes<br> <br> The simplest change. Give everyone a base of 2 or 3<br> instead of 5, and those fights will start feeling<br> painful a lot faster. Making the base 2, you'll<br> encounter a setup where 5 stress boxes -- the usual<br> default for SOTC -- is what *tough* people get. Should<br> feel a bit more right.<br> <br> Change how stress boxes behave<br> <br> Make 'em act like minion stress boxes (hit points,<br> essentially), where if you take a 3-stress hit, you<br> mark off 3 boxes. Players may be motivated to walk the<br> consequence line minor-major-severe whenever a big hit<br> comes in, and let their stress track soak up the<br> smaller hits by degrees.<br> <br> Change how consequences work.<br> <br> Make the stress track work like this: when you exceed<br> your stress boxes, you're taken out. Period.<br> <br> Consequences let you do this: reduce the amount of<br> stress you take from a particular blow.<br> <br> Take a minor consequence for a -2 to the stress dealt.<br> Take a major consequence for a -4 to the stress dealt.<br> Take a severe consequence for a -6 to the stress<br> dealt.<br> <br> I find this makes fights pretty interesting. Suppose<br> you have a 5-box stress track. Someone nails you<br> massively, a 8 point hit. Taking a minor consequence<br> isn't going to do it -- that's a 6, and still beyond<br> your stress track. You have to take a major one, at<br> least, to make it work, taking it to a 4, and<br> thankfully landing inside your stress track. The nice<br> thing about this is it breaks up the predictability of<br> the minor->major->severe consequence path.<br> <br> Combine 2 or more of the above methods<br> <br> You want super lethal? Combine all three. A base of 2,<br> acting like hitpoints, with stress reducing<br> consequences and a "you run out of stress, you're<br> taken out" philosophy will keep things smooth and fast<br> but will harken back to the terrifying lethality of<br> your Rolemaster days.<br> <br> Take any two of the above and you're still gonna see a<br> lot of blood hit the pavement.<br> <br> <br>  <br> ____________________________________________________________________________________<br> We won't tell.

So that means we get<br> to decide where it is! <br> <br> Here's what we know about Taloraan's location:<br> "Taloraan was the largest planet in the Kelavine<br> system of the Expansion Region, with a diameter of<br> 100,000 kilometers."<br> <br> The less detailed map doesn't include the Exapansion<br> Region which is between the Inner Rim and Mid Rim so<br> use your imagination to add it to Shawn's map.<br> <br> Any votes on where we place Taloraan or shall we just<br> wait until its specific location becomes important? It<br> might be a useful idea catalyst to place it on the map somewhere.<br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> ____________________________________________________________________________________<br> Need Mail bonding?<br> Go to the Yahoo!

Do<br> you have buyer's remorse about your five shifts?<br> <br> If you have no remorse -- because those extra shifts<br> became mondo stress on the bad guy, because they were<br> spent to reduce the time it took to do the thing you<br> were doing from hours to mere minutes, because they<br> were used to get you two extra really juicy facts from<br> the crime scene you're rooting around -- then, great!<br> You overshot, but overshooting just made you that much<br> more of a badass. Things are working as designed.<br> <br> If on the other hand you do regret overspending,<br> there's a problem, because it means those five shifts<br> aren't giving you any kind of value.

They ruled the world when another race - the<br> half-vegetable things of Algol's second planet - descended to earth,<br> and fought a war with bows and spears against star-crossing technology<br> - and had partial success. The Algolians' technology, a weird hybrid<br> of DNA and silicon, decayed on Earth, and the ancient race had<br> forgotten the potential of even primitive technology when backed by<br> the spirit and courage of a still-young species. The decaying race was<br> forced into the deserts of Australia, scene of the war's most<br> devastating conflicts.<br> <br> There, the mightiest Algolian weapons had been used - corruptors of<br> the Earth. Many of their bio-weapons had the side-effect of mutating<br> the local fauna to be more deadly; this can be seen in the region even<br> to this day. The changing Algolian biotechnology, its mutation speeded<br> by the radiation from several nuclear strikes, produced vast monsters<br> - towers of bone, flesh, wood, leaf, and venom. These creatures<br> devoured the Algolians, their unwitting creators, eliminating them<br> wholly from the earth.<br> <br> The monsters then raged across the lands of Earth, forming a far direr<br> threat to the Lemurians than the Algolian War itself. In the terrible<br> conflict, the monsters were destroyed, but the Lemurian Empire was so<br> damaged that it decayed to stone-age levels and vanished in a few<br> centuries.<br> <br> Though the first generation was destroyed, monsters still breed from<br> all the sites of Algolian warfare - Australia primarily, but also<br> areas scattered throughout Eurasia and the Pacific Rim. It is these<br> monsters that were slain by all the heroes of legend. If the world is<br> free of monsters for a long time - five centuries or a millennium -<br> they will be all the more terrible they will be when they at last<br> re-appear. And the last monsters were slain fifteen centuries ago.</div></html>|

It is a painful<br> and traumatic process. It is never desired by the victim, and rarely<br> intended by the Ghul. The process takes seven days after the victims<br> death, the victim becomes cognizent, but can not act, move, or speak.<br> Thus the new anpiscis will often awaken in a morgue, during funerary<br> preparation, or during the funeral. The most traumatic can be when the<br> awakening comes after the burial. Many anpisci lose their sanity from<br> the awakening and claw or chew themselves to oblivion, even before<br> their second life begins.<br> The path of communion is less traumatic, but more depraved. It is the<br> creation of true ghouls, or their proper term ghul. It results from a<br> steady, continuous diet on solely human flesh and blood. Many of the<br> grotesque and repellant characterisitics of the ghul occur from<br> frequent flesh consumption, as in the case of cannibals and deranged<br> serial killers.<br> <br> Why flesh and blood? It is traditional, and written in the holy books,<br> that flesh and blood are essential to eternal life. But the flesh must<br> be infused with prana or the omnessence of the empyreal realm, which<br> is what sustains the body for eternity. For this same, reason,<br> spiritual people and mystics are preferred food sources.<br> <br> The hermetic ideas of correspondence apply to the Ghul. Effects are<br> obtained through consumptia the act of eating particular body parts.<br> The eyes bring memories, the brain knowledge, the muscles and sinews<br> strength and resistence, the genetalia passion and virility.</div></html>|

Located at the base of the western mountains,<br> the city was originally a mining community just south of the swamps<br> founded by Qod Lilotle, Clan of the Violet Glory.<br> <br> Asklor once held the culture's great scholarly institutions, home to<br> schools of sorcery as well as the National Observatory for the Clan of<br> the Blue Moon, who traditionally headed the Astrologer's Guild. The<br> city was built far from waterways or exiting communities to mine a<br> deposit of the sacred amberite, which was dug out from beneath the<br> city itself, within it's towering walls. During the Mindat incursions<br> the capitol was moved to Minkaraph to assist in military planning.<br> Although the city is now only sparsely populated, mining continues to<br> this day.</div></html>|
2635|2635|2009-06-11 15:15:52|widderslainte|Magic Mechanics Example|<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=utf-8'></head><div id="ygrps-yiv-2138609354">Here's an appropriate spell I stole from a Reign supplement.  This<br> particular incantation would probably be found in Traditional Sorcery<br> (Precept of Milieu) and Witchcraft:<br> <br> Nyctopian Vision<br> Intensity: 2<br> Casting Time: Instant<br> Duration: Width in Minutes<br> Attunement: No<br> Effect: While this spell is in effect, the caster can use his Eerie<br> sense instead of Sight for<br> the purposes of looking into dark places. Note that this does not work<br> for looking at<br> illuminated sights, even if the sorcerer is blind.<br> <br> How does this work?  First you roll your dice pool, using the<br> appropriate magic skill (such as Traditional Sorcery) + your score in<br> the sense attribute.  This is ORE, so you're looking for matches in<br> the numbers rolled.  Because the spell has intensity 2, you need the<br> matched dice to be 2+ (a pair of one's won't do it).  The width, which<br> determines the duration of the spell is how many dice match.  Did you<br> roll three 7's (3x7 in ORE nomenclature)?  The spell lasts 3 minutes.<br> "Attunement: No" means you do not need a pact or ritual dedication<br> tying you to this style of magic.<br> <br> Attunement is more common in higher forms of Chlendi sorcery, where<br> you invoke the spirits directly into your body, or Mindat Theurgy,<br> where you seek to perfect your higher consciousness.  A proper Mindat<br> attunement may open the third eye, which is necessary for the finding<br> your way through the labyrinth of one's soul.<br> <br> What the Reign Magic mechanics lack is a drain/backlash mechanic.  I<br> suspect I'd implement something like an opposed roll between the<br> height of the roll or intensity of the spell versus the caster's<br> Command+Vigor.  That's not done all in one roll, so it may require<br> further thought.  Perhaps Waste dice compared to Command cause shock<br> damage.</div></html>|

The city militia’s citadel sites at the base of the hill,<br> regulating all traffice between the quarters. To the east, a series of<br> towers are built upon outcrops from the cliff-face. Along the upper<br> quarter a massive wall stretches along either side of the Minkush. The<br> remnants of an archway reach precariously across the river from the<br> eastern side, and towers dot the wall every 50 yards.<br> <br> Imphomonee considers itself the northern barrier of the Auld South, as<br> bastion of of culture and civility compared to it’s upriver sister<br> city, Jegelumuth. Strict rules on class mixing still apply, city<br> quarters exist for a reasons, and blades are limited to the noble or<br> knighted.<br> <br> Imphomonee is ruled by Duchess Iphia Commun, the latest regent in the<br> Commun clan that has ruled Imphomonee since the height of the Eskla<br> Empire. Imphomonee is on good relations with Vennosat and Minkarapht,<br> but finds themselves at odds with Cuvauw and Jegeldumuth (their<br> northern rival) due to ancient ties to the Jeweler’s guild.<br> <br> Organizations:<br> Notable Families/Clans: Commun (Eskla), Thive (Chlendi) Enfer<br> (Maetah), Givon (Maetah), Jhabeld (Eskla)<br> Schools & Guilds: Jeweler’s Guild, Guild of Arms, Astille (Sorcery),<br> Duslangarot (Sorcery) Lelleivanti (Sorcery)</div></html>|

Centered around the<br> ruins of Demenian, a city that the Storm Mother all but wiped from the<br> land in her wrath, are small villages and roving bands of Maetah and<br> mixed blooded people left to the wilderness.  While not as barren as<br> the Plaguelands of the west, the xenophobia of the inhabitants can be<br> just as dangerous.<br> <br> During the height of the Chlendi Empire, their fear of a return of the<br> grey plague led them to migrate disease populations (no matter how<br> minor) to work camps in the peninsula by Demenian.  As the bureaucracy<br> spread, political enemies and undesirables joined the populace.  As<br> the Chlendi might waned, the villages of the Eastern Wastes were left<br> to their own direction and communication with the cities of (now)<br> Argaevaligne and the Minkush River Valley ended.  The villages became<br> isolated and inbred, and some joined the Kuzak mountain tribes, a<br> Heteri people to the south.<br> <br> Some say an exile noble built his own domain in the ruins, calling<br> upon Maetah and Chlendi sorceries to extend his life.  Others says the<br> exile did exist, but his magicks brought down the wrath of the Storm<br> Mother which leveled Demenian, and he travels between villages in<br> search of a glimpse of sanity and hospitality.</div></html>|
